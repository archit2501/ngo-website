In 2002, Smile Foundation began as an idea\u2014to support underserved communities in India by providing them with the resources and opportunities needed for a stable life. Since its inception, Smile Foundation has worked relentlessly to create an ecosystem that enables marginalised children and youth to break free from poverty. What started as a small initiative has evolved into a national movement, impacting millions of lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2003: A Chapter of Education For Every Child<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In its early years, Smile Foundation recognised that education is the cornerstone of development. In 2003, the organisation launched Mission Education, an initiative aimed at ensuring that less-privileged children receive quality education. By establishing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Mission Education<\/strong><\/a> centres across India, Smile Foundation has provided thousands of children with access to learning resources, trained educators, and a nurturing environment. This initiative works in alignment with government educational interventions such as National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education, and Foundational Literacy and Numeracy (FLN), enabling children to continue their educational journey by being trained with the changing educational trends with a stronger foundation for the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Beyond Education with Life-Cycle Approach<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Children born into underserved communities face daunting challenges from the very start. Inadequate neonatal and maternal care weakens their cognitive development, while a lack of quality education, financial hardship, and societal norms often prevent them from reaching their potential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recognising these interlinked struggles, Smile Foundation adopted a <strong>Life-Cycle Approach <\/strong>to social development\u2014ensuring that education, healthcare, and <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/livelihood\/\"   title=\"Livelihood\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"599\">livelihood<\/a> opportunities reach the most vulnerable at every stage of their lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2005: Empowering Women through Swabhiman<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A child\u2019s first connection is with their mother, making her <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/health\/\"   title=\"Health\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"1417\">health<\/a> and well-being essential to their future. In 2005, Smile Foundation launched <strong>Swabhiman<\/strong>, a women\u2019s empowerment initiative aimed at providing maternal and child healthcare, menstrual health awareness, and financial independence for women in vulnerable communities. By working alongside government initiatives for women and Aanganwadi workers, Swabhiman has helped thousands of women to lead healthier, more independent lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2006: Taking Healthcare to the Last Mile<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From ensuring safer spaces for children, Smile Foundation expanded its mission to creating healthier communities. In 2006, the <strong>Smile on Wheels mobile healthcare programme<\/strong> was launched, bringing essential medical services to some of the remotest areas in India.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, with over 100<strong> Smile on Wheels (SoW) <\/strong>mobile units, Smile Foundation is dedicated to ensuring equitable access to healthcare for those who would otherwise be left without essential medical services. The COVID-19 pandemic reinforced the need for robust healthcare interventions, and in 2021, Smile Foundation expanded its telemedicine services, and developed an advanced telemedicine ecosystem that now facilitates diagnostic tests, foetal heartbeat monitoring, and dermoscopy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through strategic partnerships, Smile Foundation continues to strengthen healthcare accessibility and build healthier futures for communities in need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2007: Skill Development for Youth through STeP<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Education alone is not enough\u2014youth also need employable skills. In 2007, Smile Foundation launched<strong> STeP, <\/strong>a livelihood initiative designed to provide skill training in<em> <\/em>Core Employability, Healthcare, BFSI, Retail Management, Business Process Outsourcing, and Digital Marketing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With <strong>74 skilling centres <\/strong>and over<strong> 400 industry partnerships<\/strong>, including collaborations with ICICI Lombard, HDFC Life, and Fortis Hospital, STeP has been instrumental in bridging the gap between education and employment. Training programmes with Berger Paints and Amazon\u2019s 21st Century Learning Labs have further expanded upskilling opportunities, impacting thousands of young professionals and securing their future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2008: Strengthening Grassroots with Change the Game Academy<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Recognising the crucial role of grassroots initiatives, Smile Foundation launched Empowering Grassroots in 2008. Partnering with Wilde Ganzen Foundation, Smile Foundation introduced <strong>Change the Game Academy<\/strong>, supporting other local\/grassroots social development organisations through capacity-building programmes and training. By 2021, these programmes were digitised to reach an even wider audience, enabling grassroots leaders to drive sustainable impact in their communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2010: SIFFCY \u2013 Using Cinema to Inspire Young Minds<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Films have the power to educate and inspire. In 2010, Smile Foundation introduced<strong> SIFFCY (Smile International Film Festival for Children and Youth)<\/strong>, a platform that showcases meaningful global films to nurture young minds with values and a healthy perspective on life. The initiative celebrates cinema as a powerful tool for learning and social change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2011: I Am Kalam \u2013 A Story of Dreams and Determination<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In line with its commitment to education, Smile Foundation produced the critically acclaimed film<strong> I Am Kalam<\/strong>, telling the story of Chhotu, a bright, ambitious boy working at a roadside tea stall who dreams of an education, inspired by Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. The film highlights the struggles faced by marginalised children and the importance of quality education.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2012: Special Consultative Status with UN ECOSOC<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2012, Smile Foundation was granted <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/awards\/\">Special Consultative Status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (UN ECOSOC)<\/a>\u2014a prestigious recognition of its efforts in advancing sustainable development. This milestone reinforced Smile Foundation\u2019s commitment to global best practices and inspired even greater dedication to empowering marginalised communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2018: Platinum Transparency Certification by GuideStar India<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, Smile Foundation, as a dedicated social development organisation, was awarded the Platinum Transparency Certification by GuideStar India. This recognition reaffirms its commitment to ethical governance and accountability while steadfastly working towards the<strong> collective goal of societal welfare.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2021: A Great Place to Work \u2013 Strengthening the Team<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An organisation is only as strong as its people. In 2021, Smile Foundation was recognised as a<em> <\/em><strong>Great Place to Work<\/strong>, a distinction it has continued to uphold. What began as a small team in a single room has now grown into a dynamic workforce of<strong> <\/strong>600 individuals across India.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>United by a shared vision, this diverse and passionate team works tirelessly to spread smiles and empower those who aspire to a better life. Because everyone\u2014regardless of where they come from\u2014deserves dignity, opportunity, and a chance to lead a healthy, stable life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Going Forward<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our journey so far has been a harmonious blend of vision, innovation, and unwavering dedication, driven by a committed team and constant support of our corporate partners, individual supporters and volunteers who have shaped our journey in unimaginable ways by uniting in the pursuit of a better, more inclusive society.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a steadfast resolve to leave no one behind, we have geared up for new challenges and visions and therefore we, invite you to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/corporate-partnership\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Partner with us <\/a>to continue each day to write new chapters of transformation by bringing opportunities to those who lack them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When you begin something, you do not plan its success or failure\u2014you simply hope it takes the shape of your vision.
