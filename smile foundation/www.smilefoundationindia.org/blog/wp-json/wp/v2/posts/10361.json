However, this advantage is not permanent and will gradually decline as the young population ages. Before it is too late, appropriate investment in human capital development and swift and strategic efforts to unlock the potential of young India is required.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Make it now<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The desire of young people to earn money now, before they grow old and lose the ability to do so, is an urgent need of the hour. Many countries have experienced situations in which their young population has aged without being adequately prepared, posing an economic burden. The young population requires quality <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\"   title=\"Education\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2399\">education<\/a>, employment to earn and save money, skill matching, adequate healthcare, and equal access to opportunities. This will benefit them and the country&#8217;s economy. However, this is increasingly becoming a challenge for India.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are the issues?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Education plays a vital role in this undertaking. Although India\u2019s education system is progressing, significant improvement is still needed. It is important to move beyond traditional curricula and teaching methods by adopting an interdisciplinary approach that emphasizes skill development and prepares youth for the future. Additionally, substantial regional disparities exist in the availability of high-quality education in the nation. A mismatch between the skills of graduates and the needs of the job market is also leaving many underemployed or unemployed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rural areas and smaller towns often face issues such as unemployment, inadequate infrastructure, and educational disparities, which can lead to migration. As a result, urban centers experience pressures from population growth, housing challenges, and strained civic amenities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Taking the right steps<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More Jobs in More Sectors<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The economy must expand swiftly to accommodate the annual influx of millions of individuals entering the workforce. Agriculture, like other industries and services, necessitates expansion due to its substantial employment base. The issue is further complicated by income inequality. This disparity can be bridged by promoting entrepreneurship and supporting local industries. This necessitates policy support, access to credit, and skill training for prospective entrepreneurs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite India&#8217;s progress in the provision of adequate electricity, transport, and digital connectivity, job aspirants in rural areas continue to face obstacles in obtaining employment opportunities as a result of one or more of these factors. India must prioritise the development of infrastructure, digitisation, transportation, and employment in all regions through inclusive economic policies. This will promote long-term economic expansion and promote equitable growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Higher Education and Skill Development<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The global landscape is undergoing rapid transformations, and India&#8217;s education system must adapt to these changes. It is crucial to introduce courses that emphasise technology, innovation, and employability skills to equip students for the future. In a global labour market that is constantly changing, technical, behavioural, and digital skills are essential. Apprenticeships, which are on-the-job training programs with classroom learning structured to provide a comprehensive comprehension of a specific profession, are a means of acquiring these. Internships are a valuable resource for acquiring practical experience in a particular industry or position. Mentoring can provide a supportive environment for young individuals to learn, develop, and prepare for the workplace. An increase in the availability of career counselling is also important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Awareness of Government Initiatives<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The availability of government-run skill development programs has little visibility, therefore their validity, quality, and effectiveness are also doubted. To enhance the uptake of existing programs, it is critical to create awareness and make the programs relevant, affordable and accessible. Policies that encourage investment in underdeveloped areas can reduce migration and promote balanced growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Role of the Private Sector<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The private sector must assume a more proactive role in the development of the capabilities and skills of the youth of India. This will guarantee that training initiatives are driven by industry demands and that they provide skills that are in alignment with those requirements. Career guidance activities with industry professionals, including seminars, lectures, and workplace visits, can be added to these programs. By combining resources, expertise, and innovation, public-private partnerships can expedite progress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Investments in Healthcare<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Making investments in healthcare infrastructure is indispensable.\u00a0Preventive healthcare must be prioritised on a national scale. Reducing the burden on the healthcare system can be achieved by increasing awareness of nutrition, hygiene, and lifestyle diseases. Another critical area that requires attention is mental <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/health\/\"   title=\"Health\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"1401\">health<\/a>. Primary healthcare systems should incorporate mental health services that are both affordable and accessible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Smile and the youth<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Smile Foundation is dedicated to empowering underserved youth in India through various initiatives aimed at enhancing their skills and improving their employment prospects. One of the key programs is the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/livelihood\/\">Smile Twin e-Learning Programme (STeP)<\/a>, launched in 2007, which provides training in areas such as English proficiency, basic computer education, retail management, personality development, and other soft skills. This comprehensive approach prepares urban underserved youth for careers in emerging sectors like retail, services, and BPOs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to STeP, Smile Foundation has expanded its reach by adding 13 more centers dedicated to the training and employment of urban youth. These centers aim to benefit thousands of young individuals by offering courses that align with current market demands, thereby enhancing their employability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, Smile Foundation&#8217;s skilling program plans to train thousands of youth in the healthcare sector, focusing on individuals aged 18 to 35.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through these targeted programs, Smile Foundation strives to equip the youth with the necessary skills and opportunities to secure sustainable livelihoods and contribute positively to society.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>India\u2019s young population will start ageing soon, and the window of opportunity will start closing. To satisfy the aspirations of young people to secure their futures and earn money now, India must act swiftly.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>India&#8217;s young population offers it a distinct demographic advantage.
