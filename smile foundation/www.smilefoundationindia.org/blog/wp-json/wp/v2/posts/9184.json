As India\u2019s economy continues to expand, the demand for blue-collar jobs is set to grow substantially, with projections indicating that these roles will drive <a href=\"https:\/\/hr.economictimes.indiatimes.com\/news\/trends\/blue-collar-jobs-to-drive-70-pc-of-indias-new-job-growth-by-2030-report\/109449115\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">70% of new job growth by 2030<\/a>. This growth is fueled by factors such as urbanisation, the rise of e-commerce and the increasing demand for essential services, all of which rely heavily on blue-collar workers for operational success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The surge in blue-collar job opportunities underscores the importance of skill development and training for this workforce segment. Upskilling initiatives not only improve the employability of these workers but also enhance their potential for career advancement and economic mobility. As industries continue to evolve with technological advancements and changing consumer needs, equipping blue-collar workers with the necessary skills like upskilling painters will be important to ensure they can contribute effectively and benefit from the country\u2019s economic growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>iTrain on Wheels <\/em>initiative with Berger Paints<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The collaboration between Smile Foundation and Berger Paints India Ltd. under the <strong>iTrain on Wheels<\/strong> initiative is making a significant impact on communities across India. Launched in 2021, this programme aims to enhance the skills and employability of painters by offering comprehensive training in both communication and technical skills. The initiative targets aspiring and experienced painters, equipping them with modern techniques and tools needed to meet market demands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the unique aspects of the programme is its mobile nature, reaching over 100 remote sites across 24 states through mobile iTrain vans. These vans bring training directly to the painters, who otherwise would have limited access to such resources. The sessions are designed to be hands-on and practical, focusing on overcoming communication barriers and ensuring that all participants, regardless of their educational backgrounds, can easily understand and apply the training. This approach not only improves the skills of our painters but also empowers them to become entrepreneurs and elevate their economic status.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Stories of Transformation and Empowerment<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The impact of the iTrain on Wheels initiative is best illustrated through the inspiring stories of its participants. <strong>Sakhiat Pala Laloo<\/strong> from Shillong, Meghalaya, is one such example. Despite facing numerous challenges, she aspired to become a paint contractor and empower other women in her community. Through the iTrain programme, she learned advanced techniques and gained the confidence to overcome obstacles. Today, she leads a successful painting business and continues to inspire others with her journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, <strong>Ferdinancy Laloo<\/strong> from Shillong wanted to support her family better amidst rising living costs. She joined the programme to enhance her painting skills and quickly established herself as a professional in the market. Her dedication paid off as she saw her income increase by over 300%, allowing her to provide a better life for her children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another remarkable story is that of <strong>Bhanuben<\/strong>, who chose to upskill herself after losing her husband. Her determination to learn advanced decorative painting techniques through the iTrain programme led to significant professional growth. She now earns a steady income and trains others in her community, fostering employment and economic development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Bridging Gaps and Creating Opportunities<\/strong> <strong>through upskilling painters<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The success stories don&#8217;t end there. <strong>Amrutben<\/strong> is another inspiring example of how <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/livelihood\/\"   title=\"Livelihood\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"646\">skill development<\/a> can transform lives. Initially working on construction sites, she joined the programme to acquire advanced painting skills. Despite being one of the few women in the programme, her commitment to learning helped her become a leader in her field. Today, she leads a team of 8-10 people and earns a substantial monthly income. Her story demonstrates the transformative power of skill development and the potential for women to break barriers in traditionally male-dominated fields.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Celebration of Journeys: &#8216;From Canvas to Community&#8217;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To celebrate the impact of the iTrain on Wheels initiative, Smile Foundation and Berger Paints launched a coffee table book titled <strong>&#8216;From Canvas to Community&#8217;<\/strong> recently at Oxford Bookstore of Kolkata. The book chronicles the inspiring journeys of 12 painters who transformed their lives through the programme. It serves as a testament to the power of vocational training and skill development in empowering individuals and uplifting communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Strategic Vision and Digital Initiatives<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recent discussion, <strong>Mr. Santanu Mishra<\/strong> (Co-Founder and Executive Trustee of Smile Foundation) praised the passion and dedication of the Berger team. He emphasised that the partnership goes beyond <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/corporate-partnership\/\"   title=\"Corporate Partnerships\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"386\">CSR<\/a> activity, reflecting a strong commitment to social investment. <strong>Mr. Abhijit Roy<\/strong> (MD &amp; CEO, Berger Paints India Ltd) outlined a broader vision for the programme<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;Beyond merely upskilling painters, the goal is to elevate their social standing and ensure they receive the respect they deserve.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>To further support this vision, Berger Paints is pioneering digital initiatives aimed at helping painters become self-sustaining entrepreneurs. One such initiative is the introduction of QR-coded cards, which allow customers to instantly access a painter&#8217;s credentials. This innovation fosters trust between painters and customers, ensuring quality workmanship and enhancing the marketability of painters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The way forward for upskilling painters<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The iTrain on Wheels initiative is a movement towards a more inclusive and empowered society. By upskilling painters, the initiative is helping to bridge the gap between aspiration and achievement. It underscores the importance of vocational training in enhancing employability and economic development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the initiative continues to expand, its impact will only grow, helping more painters across India achieve their dreams and contribute to their communities. The stories of Sakhiat, Ferdinancy, Bhanuben and Amrutben are just the beginning of what promises to be a long and inspiring journey of transformation and empowerment through skill development. Here is to painting a brighter, more colourful future for all.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Blue-collar workers form a significant portion of India\u2019s workforce, accounting for over 80% of the non-agricultural employment sector.
