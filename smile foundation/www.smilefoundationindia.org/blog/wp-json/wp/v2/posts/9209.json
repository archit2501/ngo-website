According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), the overall <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-india-59428011\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sex ratio in India is 1,020 females for every 1,000 males<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this may look promising, the problem actually lies in the details. The sex ratio varies widely between the states. For example, while Kerala has a sex ratio of 1084 females per 1000 males, Haryana, on the other hand, has only <a href=\"https:\/\/statisticstimes.com\/demographics\/country\/india-sex-ratio.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">879 females for every 1000 males<\/a>. This disparity within the states leads to serious illegal activities like paying money to get brides from other states.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Eradicating the problem from the root<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The problems of female foeticide and infanticide have existed in India in the past which led to the passing of Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PNDT) Act of 1994 which banned sex-determination and sex-selective abortions. However, it cannot be said with surety that the problem has completely been eliminated. While legal measures are important to deal with this situation, what works the best is cultural and societal transformation. By bringing in a change in the way people think about girl child, we can ensure that this problem is eradicated from its root. This is where <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\"   title=\"Education\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2271\">education<\/a> comes in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Education is a fundamental right and a powerful tool for social change. In India, where gender disparities are deeply entrenched, education can play a crucial role in protecting and empowering the girl child. There are numerous examples of girls in different parts of the country who have to leave schools because they are forced to take care of household chores or simply because the parents do not think that education is any good for a girl child since eventually, she has to get married and take care of her husband\u2019s family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This creates a deep chasm between how girls and boys are treated and the opportunities that are made available to them. If the girl child is seen only has a burden, it is only through education that she can be allowed to grow and pave a path for herself. Let\u2019s take a deeper look at how education can protect girl child in India:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Impact on Child Marriage<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest impacts of ensuring education to girl children is that it eliminates the problem of child marriage. When girl children are encouraged to study and build careers, it protects them from the possibility of being married off at a young age. According to UNICEF, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unicef.org\/india\/what-we-do\/gender-equality\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">girls with secondary education are six times less likely to marry<\/a> as children compared to those with no education. The <a href=\"https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3681232\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) data shows<\/a> that the median age at first marriage for women with 12 or more years of schooling is 22.7 years, compared to 17.2 years for those with no schooling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Economic Empowerment<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Another positive impact of education is that it enables the girls to find relevant employment opportunities and become financially independent. By doing this, they are not just able to take care of themselves but also their families. This also helps in breaking the societal myth that it is only the men who are supposed to be breadwinners. Educated girls are more likely to participate in the workforce and contribute to their families\u2019 economic well-being. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ijfans.org\/uploads\/paper\/87cdeedd90ed359419b9d70288acc30d.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">study by the World Bank<\/a> found that every additional year of schooling for girls increases their future earnings by 10-20%. This economic empowerment helps break the cycle of poverty and reduces the likelihood of exploitation and abuse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Health and Well-Being<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>While it may not seem like a direct correlation, but it has been found that education significantly impacts the well-being and <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/health\/\"   title=\"Health\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"1295\">health<\/a> of women. This is because educated women are aware of the needs and requirements of their bodies. They are more likely to seek health assistance for themselves and their children leading to better health outcomes for the family. The <a href=\"https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3681232\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NFHS-4 data indicates<\/a> that children of mothers with no education are twice as likely to die before their fifth birthday compared to children of mothers with at least a secondary education<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Social and Cultural Change<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Educating the girl children creates a positive circle of social and cultural change because educated women are more likely to fight for their right as well as the rights of other women. It also enxourages critical thinking and challenges traditional gender norms. Educated women are also more likely to influence policy decisions and fight against existing ills in our society. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Kanchan-Joshi-14\/publication\/353958214_IMPORTANCE_OF_GIRL_CHILD_EDUCATION_IN_INDIA\/links\/611c021e1ca20f6f862c8a9a\/IMPORTANCE-OF-GIRL-CHILD-EDUCATION-IN-INDIA.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">increase in female literacy rates from 53.7% in 2001 to 70.3% in 2011 reflects a positive shift<\/a> towards gender equality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Legal Frameworks and Policies<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, India has implemented several policies to promote girls\u2019 education, including the Right to Education Act (2009), which guarantees free and compulsory education for children aged 6 to 14. Recently, the central government has launched dedicated campaigns to spread awareness for gender equality and educating the girl child. One such example is the <a href=\"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/heapol\/article\/33\/7\/870\/5068218\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Beti Bachao Beti Padhao<\/em> (BBBP) scheme<\/a>, launched in 2015, which aims to address the declining child sex ratio and promote girls\u2019 education and empowerment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Barriers to Girls\u2019 Education<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite all these interventions and the overall change in the societal construct around education of girl child, several factors still hinder the equal access to education for girl child. These include poverty, cultural norms, safety concerns, and inadequate infrastructure. In a poor household, it is the male child who is more likely to be favoured to get an education as compared to a girl child. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Kanchan-Joshi-14\/publication\/353958214_IMPORTANCE_OF_GIRL_CHILD_EDUCATION_IN_INDIA\/links\/611c021e1ca20f6f862c8a9a\/IMPORTANCE-OF-GIRL-CHILD-EDUCATION-IN-INDIA.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">report by the International Center for Research on Women<\/a> (ICRW), 40% of adolescent girls in the age group of 15-18 years are not attending school. This shows that there is still a long way to go if we want to ensure education for every girl child in India.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Role of NGOs and Community Initiatives<\/strong> <strong>to Protect Girl Child<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Non-government organisations (NGOs) play a critical role in solving this problem by providing scholarship support, improving infrastructure, addressing security issues and raising awareness among the communities. Community initiatives, such as the formation of mothers\u2019 groups and village education committees, also contribute to creating a supportive environment for girls\u2019 education. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we are able to educate our girl children and bring them at an equal level as the male child, it will bring a cultural change where girls will not be seen as burden anymore. Thus, it will protect the girl child and help in creating a more equitable society.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Education is a powerful tool that can protect and empower the girl child in India. By delaying marriage, improving health outcomes, and fostering economic independence, education helps girls break free from the cycle of poverty and discrimination. However, achieving universal education for girls requires addressing the persistent barriers and ensuring sustained efforts from all stakeholders, including the government, NGOs and communities. By intervening in this area, we can ensure safety and protection of girl child and education is the key to this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smile Foundation\u2019s <strong>Girl Child Education Campaign<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Smile Foundation<\/a>\u2019s <em><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/donate.smilefoundationindia.org\/donate-for-girl-child\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">She Can Fly<\/a><\/strong> <\/em>is dedicated to bridging the educational gap for girls in underserved communities across India. The campaign operates with a mission to empower young girls by ensuring they receive the education they deserve, thereby breaking the societal cycle of discrimination and limited opportunities. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By focusing on holistic education, the campaign doesn\u2019t just aim to teach girls basic academic subjects\u2014it seeks to nurture their confidence, critical thinking, and leadership skills. Education, after all, is the key to equipping these girls to challenge the societal norms that often hold them back. As girls become more educated, they gain the power to make informed decisions, stand up for their rights, and become change-makers in their communities, ultimately transforming both their lives and the lives of those around them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For decades, India struggled with the problem of skewed sex ratio owing to the gender discrimination with people favouring a male child over female.
