UNICEF notes that SDG&nbsp;4 explicitly emphasises that vulnerable groups (poor, rural, indigenous, refugees, persons with disabilities) must benefit from inclusive education. In practice, this means schooling must respect local languages and cultures. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>UNESCO stresses that \u201cminorities and indigenous people require an <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\"   title=\"Education\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2464\">education<\/a> system that respects their cultural, linguistic and religious needs\u201d \u2013 for example through bilingual, intercultural curricula and dedicated budgets. Without such measures, indigenous children face disproportionately high dropout rates and low learning outcomes compared to national averages. As a recent&nbsp;<em>UNESCO<\/em>&nbsp;report notes, simply enrolling children in school is not enough; curricula, teaching and community outreach must be tailored to local realities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>India\u2019s new education policy acknowledges this challenge. The&nbsp;<strong>NEP&nbsp;2020<\/strong>&nbsp;recognises that \u201cchildren from tribal communities often find their school education irrelevant and foreign to their lives, both culturally and academically,\u201d and calls for \u201cspecial mechanisms\u201d to ensure these students benefit from education reforms. Tribal and first-generation learners often juggle long commutes, economic hardship, and language barriers (e.g. a sudden shift to English instruction), which makes bridging programmes essential. Failure to address these gaps entrenches inequalities: without help, many tribal youth drop out around the secondary level, when high-stakes board exams and complex subjects create bottlenecks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Smile Foundation\u2019s Adilabad initiative for tribal students<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In Telangana\u2019s Adilabad district \u2013 home to many Adivasi communities \u2013 these challenges are front and center. The&nbsp;<strong>Tribal Welfare Department<\/strong>&nbsp;runs 67 residential&nbsp;<em>Ashram<\/em>&nbsp;high schools that offer free lodging and schooling to tribal youth. In late 2024, Smile Foundation teamed up with the state\u2019s Tribal Welfare (ITDA) agency to launch the&nbsp;<em>Academic Enhancement and Examination Preparedness<\/em>&nbsp;(AEEP) programme in all 67 schools. AEEP represents a classic public\u2013NGO partnership: the government provides classrooms and student outreach, while Smile contributes tutors, training and materials. This programme targeted roughly&nbsp;<strong>2,700 students<\/strong>&nbsp;(67% of them girls) preparing for the 10th-grade board exams. Its aim was simple but vital: to shore up basic learning (especially in English, math and science), build test-taking confidence, and bridge gaps created by recent reforms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The need was urgent. Until 2023 these Ashram schools taught in Telugu, but the state mandated English as the medium, and exam papers were issued only in English. Students with little prior English instruction suddenly faced foreign-language exams. As Smile\u2019s report notes, \u201cthe students who have been taught Telugu were taught English since the last two years\u201d \u2013 yet \u201cthe SSC board decided the question paper would also be given in English\u201d. Faced with this \u201chuge bottleneck,\u201d Smile and local officials designed AEEP as a&nbsp;<em>crash course<\/em>&nbsp;in academic basics and exam strategy. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over January\u2013March 2025, they held&nbsp;<strong>268 academic sessions<\/strong>&nbsp;across the 67 schools. These included mock tests, problem-solving workshops in Maths\/Science, and counseling on exam preparation. Facilitators (often recruited locally) used standardised lesson plans and materials vetted by subject experts. Crucially, Smile distributed a bespoke 875-page \u201cAll-in-One\u201d SSC guidebook \u2013 covering all subjects in simple language \u2013 to every board student. This leveled the playing field by giving village students the study tools usually only available to better-off peers. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/IMG-20250211-WA0055-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11287\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/IMG-20250211-WA0055-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/IMG-20250211-WA0055-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/IMG-20250211-WA0055-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/IMG-20250211-WA0055.jpg 1156w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One Tribal Welfare officer reports that students and teachers welcomed the materials: the handbooks reduced financial burden and boosted learners\u2019 confidence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The impact of AEEP\u2019s approach is tangible. By project\u2019s end, every one of the 67 schools had hosted multiple coaching sessions, reaching a combined&nbsp;<strong>2,701 students and 376 teachers<\/strong>. Over 1,800 girls participated (reflecting the schools\u2019 strong female enrollment). Weekly quizzes and feedback loops identified learning gaps and progressively raised test scores. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Preliminary outcomes show significant improvements in exam pass rates for participating villages, though formal evaluations are pending. Importantly, the programme built trust between families and schools: community meetings and local-language tutors helped parents feel invested in their children\u2019s success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/IMG-20250217-WA0056-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11288\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/IMG-20250217-WA0056-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/IMG-20250217-WA0056-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/IMG-20250217-WA0056-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/IMG-20250217-WA0056-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/IMG-20250217-WA0056.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Global innovations in inclusive education<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>India\u2019s tribal initiatives echo successful models elsewhere. In&nbsp;<strong>Brazil<\/strong>, for example, the government\u2019s indigenous affairs agency (FUNAI) and education ministry support&nbsp;<em>escolas ind\u00edgenas<\/em>, where instruction is adapted to native cultures and languages. Brazil\u2019s 1988 constitution and subsequent laws guarantee intercultural, bilingual education, enabling Amazonian communities to design schools that blend traditional knowledge with core subjects. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Studies find that these programmes boost attendance and cultural pride by making schooling relevant to indigenous worldview. Rather than forcing assimilation, Brazil now emphasises curricula that respect native languages and lineages \u2013 a practice UNESCO cites as essential for indigenous inclusion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In&nbsp;<strong>Kenya<\/strong>, the challenge is reaching children in remote arid regions. The government\u2019s Primary Education Development Plan has explicitly targeted marginalised schools. With support from the Global Partnership for Education, some 4,000 schools \u2013 including 1,400 in Kenya\u2019s poorest counties \u2013 received school improvement grants. Each school got about USD&nbsp;5,500 to build toilets, train teachers, and raise community awareness of girls\u2019 education and safety. These grants also funded volunteer patrols to accompany girls to school, helping Kenya close the gender attendance gap. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, Kenya\u2019s nationwide textbook reforms illustrate the power of targeted support. By competitive procurement, the government cut costs by 70% and distributed&nbsp;<strong>over 10.5 million math textbooks<\/strong>&nbsp;for early grades in just two years. Many of these books were specially adapted with Braille and enlarged print to serve children with disabilities, signaling an inclusive vision. (The accompanying image shows a Kenyan schoolgirl with her new textbooks.) Kenya\u2019s concerted efforts have paid off: primary enrollment is now effectively universal, and gender parity has nearly been achieved. Initiatives like distributing textbooks in refugee camps (Kakuma) further underscore Kenya\u2019s commitment to \u201cno learner left behind,\u201d be they nomads or newcomers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Australia\u2019s remote schools also benefit from tailored policies. The federal \u201cClosing the Gap\u201d plan invested in the&nbsp;<strong>Remote School Attendance Strategy (RSAS)<\/strong>, which shifted in 2019 from simply \u201cgetting kids to school\u201d toward \u201ckeeping kids in school\u201d. The revamped RSAS employs local Aboriginal liaisons and focuses on community engagement: local people encourage attendance, organise transport, and work with schools to solve problems. This model acknowledges that trust and local leadership are essential in isolated communities. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other Australian measures mirror this community-centric philosophy: scholarships (e.g. boosting STEM for Indigenous girls), partnerships with elders, and state\u2013federal cooperation. In each case, the common thread is clear \u2013 empower the community to uplift the school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These international examples highlight key elements of success that mirror Smile\u2019s approach in India. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>First,&nbsp;<strong>local engagement<\/strong>: hiring local tutors, involving parents and traditional leaders, and using native languages all build ownership. <\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Second,&nbsp;<strong>cultural relevance<\/strong>: curricula that incorporate tribal knowledge or bilingual materials make learning less alien. <\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Third,&nbsp;<strong>remedial and bridge instruction<\/strong>: providing extra coaching in core subjects, particularly at transition points like board exams, closes learning gaps. <\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fourth,&nbsp;<strong>continuous feedback<\/strong>: regular testing and adaptive lesson plans ensure programs respond to real needs. <\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Finally,&nbsp;<strong>sustained support and partnerships<\/strong>: none of these works as a one-off. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In Telangana, Smile\u2019s coordination with the tribal welfare department and school officials provided continuity. Similarly, in Australia and Kenya, government initiatives were bolstered by NGO and private partners. For example, Smile\u2019s award-winning&nbsp;<strong>NXplorers<\/strong>&nbsp;STEM programme (with Shell) now reaches thousands of rural students by training teachers and engaging girls in engineering projects. Public\u2013private collaborations like these multiply impact and help embed innovations into official systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Recommendations: Scaling up equity for marginalised and tribal students <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Telangana case \u2013 and its global parallels \u2013 make clear that targeted investment can yield rapid gains for marginalised students. We offer several policy recommendations:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Strengthen public\u2013NGO partnerships.<\/strong>&nbsp;Governments and international donors should empower local NGOs to fill gaps. Initiatives like Smile\u2019s AEEP show that NGOs can mobilise quickly and innovate pedagogically. Funds and training (e.g. through Samagra Shiksha or GPE grants) can be channeled to community-based organisations in tribal areas. Institutionalise models such as ITDA\u2013NGO co-management of ashram schools.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Invest in remedial and transition programmes.<\/strong>&nbsp;Scale remedial coaching, bridge courses and exam-prep camps for disadvantaged students, as envisioned by NEP&nbsp;2020. Board exam stakes are high in India; dedicated support for Class 10 and 12 candidates from tribal backgrounds (tutoring, model exams, study materials) can dramatically improve pass rates.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Recruit and train local educators.<\/strong>&nbsp;Hire teachers and facilitators from within tribal communities. They are more likely to speak local dialects, understand cultural contexts, and gain trust. Provide these teachers with ongoing professional development, as well as pedagogical tools for multilingual education. Australia\u2019s RSAS demonstrates that employing local liaison officers strengthens attendance and accountability.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use culturally responsive curriculum.<\/strong>&nbsp;Educational content must reflect tribal students\u2019 lives. This means bilingual textbooks, examples drawn from local ecology and culture, and integration of indigenous history. Allocating specific budgets for developing such materials, as recommended by UNESCO and India\u2019s policy think-tanks, is vital. The MDPI study on Brazilian indigenous schooling shows that when education values tribal knowledge, communities respond with greater engagement and pride.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Enhance community engagement.<\/strong>&nbsp;Regularly involve parents, village councils and NGOs in school governance. Encourage community-driven monitoring of attendance and learning. Examples from Kenya and India alike show that when families see the value in education (through counseling sessions, scholarships, women\u2019s literacy programs), enrollment and retention rise. Gender-focused outreach (mentoring girls, building girls\u2019 hostels, abolishing child marriage) also helps meet&nbsp;<strong>SDG&nbsp;5<\/strong>&nbsp;on gender equality within tribal areas.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Align with national and global goals.<\/strong>&nbsp;Embed these efforts in broader frameworks. For instance, link tribal education programmes to SDG&nbsp;4 and SDG&nbsp;5 targets, NEP 2020\u2019s equity provisions, and India\u2019s Aspirational District Programme. Create measurable indicators (e.g. tribal literacy rates, board exam performance) to track progress explicitly. The AEEP project itself framed its goals around SDGs&nbsp;4 and&nbsp;5, a practice all programmes should adopt to leverage international support and accountability.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In sum, the Adilabad initiative provides an encouraging proof of concept: with concerted effort, the cycle of marginalisation can be broken. Learning outcomes in these 67 Ashram schools are improving because the programme meets tribal students \u201cwhere they are,\u201d academically and culturally. This lesson is universal. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the world races toward 2030, every country must ask:\u00a0<strong>Who is being left behind in our classrooms?<\/strong>\u00a0Then fund and design programmes \u2013 like Telangana\u2019s AEEP \u2013 that ensure those children also thrive. By combining public commitment, community knowledge, and innovative partnerships, we can bring high-quality education within reach of all. Educating tribal and marginalised children is an investment in a more equitable and prosperous society for everyone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Sources and References<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Smile Foundation (2025)<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0<em>Mission Education: Academic Enhancement and Examination Preparedness Project Completion Report (AEEP, Adilabad)<\/em>.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a class=\"\" href=\"https:\/\/sdgs.un.org\/goals\/goal4\">SDG 4: Quality Education<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a class=\"\" href=\"https:\/\/sdgs.un.org\/goals\/goal5\">SDG 5: Gender Equality<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a class=\"\" href=\"https:\/\/unstats.un.org\/sdgs\/report\/2023\/\">UN SDG Progress Report 2023<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>UNESCO (2023)<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0<em>Global Education Monitoring Report: Ensuring Inclusion and Equity in Education for Indigenous and Minority Children<\/em>.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a class=\"\" href=\"https:\/\/en.unesco.org\/gem-report\/\">GEM Report Site<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>UNICEF (2022)<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0<em>Education for Every Child: The Role of Equity in SDG 4<\/em>.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a>UNICEF Education<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ministry of Education, Government of India (2020)<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0<em>National Education Policy (NEP) 2020<\/em>.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a>Official NEP Document<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Global Partnership for Education (GPE) \u2013 Kenya Country Page<\/strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a>Kenya\u2019s Learning Strategy<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>World Bank (2020)<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0<em>Kenya Basic Education Improvement Project<\/em>.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a class=\"\" href=\"https:\/\/projects.worldbank.org\/en\/projects-operations\/project-detail\/P160083\">Project Page<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>MDPI (2021)<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0<em>The Role of Intercultural and Bilingual Education in Brazil\u2019s Indigenous Schools<\/em>.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a>MDPI Education Sciences<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Australian Government \u2013 National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA)<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><em>Remote School Attendance Strategy (RSAS)<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a>Closing the Gap Report 2023<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Shell NXplorers &amp; Smile Foundation (2023)<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a class=\"\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/\">Smile Foundation\u2019s STEM education collaborations<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Government of India (2023)<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0<em>Annual Report &amp; Statistics on Scheduled Tribes<\/em>.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a>MoTA Official Site<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Right to Education Forum, India (2022)<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0<em>Leaving No Child Behind: Education Disparities Among India\u2019s Tribes and Minorities<\/em>.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a class=\"\" href=\"https:\/\/rteforumindia.org\/\">RTE India<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>ASER Report (2022)<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0<em>Annual Status of Education Report \u2013 Rural Learning Outcomes in India<\/em>.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a class=\"\" href=\"https:\/\/www.asercentre.org\/\">ASER Centre<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>World Inequality Report (2022)<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0<em>Educational Inequality and Social Mobility Metrics in Global South<\/em>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a>World Inequality Lab<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Governments worldwide have committed to&nbsp;SDG&nbsp;4&nbsp;\u2013 quality education for all \u2013 yet the most marginalised, including indigenous and tribal students, lag far behind.
