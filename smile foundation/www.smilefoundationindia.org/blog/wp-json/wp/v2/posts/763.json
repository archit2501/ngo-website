The education survey revealed some encouraging figures, the most important of which indicated that\u00a0<strong>78% of children wanted to go back to classroom learning<\/strong>,\u00a0<strong>48% of children were ready to continue in the blended mode<\/strong>\u00a0of learning and\u00a0<strong>39% children were partly aware of COVID safety regulations<\/strong>\u00a0at schools.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>These education survey studies, in the course of the last 2 years,\u00a0<strong>helped us at Smile Foundation to understand the challenges faced by children in terms of <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/health\/\"   title=\"Health\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"985\">health<\/a>, nutrition, and progress of education<\/strong>\u00a0through the several ways of teaching-learning exchanges rolled out during the period. These periodic surveys helped to stay abreast of the new challenges that were unfolding in terms of increasing dropouts, decreased attendance, fall in age-appropriate learning levels among children, and the overall effects on children\u2019s educational, social, and emotional and psychological growth and development.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Introduction<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>At the turn of the decade, the untoward occurrence of COVID-19 impelled the education system to rethink, renew and rediscover the teaching-learning processes for children worldwide, to ensure a continuum in learning. The educational institutions across India, braved the challenges of distant locations, absence of network and digital facilities, restrictions in movements, and remote learning from home, to reach out to the children.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The recent report, The State of Global Learning Poverty: 2022 Update, a joint publication of the World Bank, UNICEF, FCDO, USAID, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and in partnership with UNESCO, emphasizes that the learning crisis has worsened. It says that before the pandemic around 57% of 10-year-olds were unable to read or write as per their age, which has increased rapidly in the last two years post the pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>This report is an attempt to understand the extent of learning loss that has resulted in India through a study conducted through our students\u2019 beneficiaries at Smile Foundation. The study aims to assess the learning gaps and suggest mechanisms to recover the learning loss for the benefit of educationists and educational institutions to improve and innovate the existing teaching-learning methodologies.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h6>Broad\u00a0<strong>objectives<\/strong>:<\/h6>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reach out to every child and understand the challenges in retaining them in school<\/li>\n<li>Assess learning levels<\/li>\n<li>Prioritize teaching the fundamentals<\/li>\n<li>Increase catch-up learning and progress beyond what was lost<\/li>\n<li>Develop psychosocial health and well-being so every child is ready to learn<\/li>\n<li>Gender-specific study in school retention<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5>\u00a0<\/h5>\n<h5><strong>Education Survey Coverage<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Profile of the Respondents:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>For the education survey, we planned to reach all sections of the students particularly the underserved communities who have limited access to virtual communication to get the right kind of sampling for the survey.
