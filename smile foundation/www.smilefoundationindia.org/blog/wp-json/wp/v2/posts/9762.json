Education for girls and women can shape how families, communities, children and an entire society may bring about changes for a better world.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Educating a girl can change so much around us. An educated girl can always grow up to be financially mobile, safe and empowered while being determined to choose the course of her own life and help others understand the many gendered nuances of society.<br><br>While educating girls is the backbone of development and despite several global declarations and development goals with significant efforts by the international community, gender disparity in education continues to deepen the education divide.<br><br>Despite growing evidence and large-scale emphasis on educating girls, a large segment of our society, particularly in developing countries, needs more action, resources and awareness to educate the critical population\u2014their girls and women. According to UNESCO data, two-thirds of the illiterate adult population in the world are women, with over 63 million girls around the world out of school. Among them, 47% of out-of-school girls are never expected to enrol longer in studies.<br><br>The data are more upsetting in the context of India. In the latest Global Gender Gap Report released by the World Economic Forum (WEF) for 2024, India dropped to 126 out of 146 economies due to worsening conditions in educational attainment among women and girls. The findings reflect a notable decline in gender equality, underscoring the ongoing challenges faced by the country in bridging gender disparities and achieving gender equality across various sectors, especially education.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why should you donate for girl child education?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every child has a right to education. Regardless of their social status, economic conditions, race, caste, class and, least of all, gender, every child must receive education on equal terms. When you donate for girl child education, you can help disbalance the status quo of who should and should not receive education and push for access to quality teachers, educational institutions and opportunities to flourish.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Bridging the gender gap<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To date, the world is largely ruled by gender discrimination and hence, educating and empowering girls continues to be less valued. Lack of girls&#8217; education is the cause of several societal evils which push them into it &#8211; child marriage, trafficking, labour exploitation, assault and such acts. Her childhood gets cut short \u2013 her very life and future are at risk. Donating to girls&#8217; education can help reduce discrimination with more teacher training programmes, organising community workshops, helping set schools for girls and pulling in resources that can help in development work for girls&#8217; education. A gender-equitable education is key to empowering girls and bridging pay gaps, reducing school dropouts, gender-based violence and practices, child marriage and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Breaking the vicious cycle of poverty<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Investing in girls\u2019 education is one of the wisest ways of breaking the cycles of intergenerational poverty. When girls become educated, they have better access to resources and choices in their lives\u2014to lead better, fairer and more productive lives. A recent UNESCO report suggests that about 50% of adolescents cannot complete their secondary education due to low family income and a lack of parental awareness. Then, when girls can complete their education, they secure better jobs and are more likely to support their families as research shows that educated women are more likely to invest in their children\u2019s education, creating a ripple effect that benefits generations to come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Boosting the economy<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Up to $30 trillion might be added to the world economy if all girls could finish their secondary school. It has been widely observed that countries with greater female literacy report faster economic growth and donating to girls&#8217; education can foster innovation, boost production, and develop a workforce with greater expertise. Families, communities and the nation at large may all profit economically from investing in girls&#8217; education. Girls with higher educational degrees can make significant contributions to supporting the nation&#8217;s economy by working and paying taxes, which can boost the economy as a whole.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Improving health and well-being<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Donating to girls\u2019 education also promotes healthier families and communities by keeping them educated about nutrition, maternal and sexual <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/health\/\"   title=\"Health\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"1350\">health<\/a>. With an increasing number of educated girls, communities grow healthier and have fewer maternal and child fatalities. With economic independence, women are better able to make decisions about their own and their family&#8217;s health care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Initiatives of Smile Foundation<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the path to inclusive education and gender equality has its challenges, it is also full of opportunities. India can create a better future where all girls have equal access to education &#8211; leading to overcoming obstacles, dispelling myths and fostering an atmosphere that supports them, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/\">Smile Foundation<\/a>&#8216;s programmes. Through the \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/donate.smilefoundationindia.org\/donate-for-girl-child\">She Can Fly\u2019<\/a> initiative, Smile is aimed at enabling and empowering girls to become self-reliant and rise to their full potential through interventions in education, vocational and skill training, and healthcare and nutrition. Besides this, communities and parents also need to be made more aware of the need to donate for girl child education in India. Through its <em><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/donate.smilefoundationindia.org\/donate-for-education\/\">Shiksha Na Ruke<\/a><\/strong><\/em> campaign, Smile is working hard to reduce the educational gap throughout India which places a strong emphasis on reducing the gender gap in education.<br><br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cIf you educate a man, you educate an individual, but if you educate a woman, you educate a family (nation).\u201d Mahatma Gandhi Educating girls goes beyond imparting knowledge\u2014it is key to the development of society.
