In the relentless pursuit of GDP growth and digital innovation, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that\u00a0<strong>only 37% of women receive healthcare<\/strong>\u00a0in India, according to a study conducted by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and Harvard University.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not only a healthcare problem but a societal crisis. When a woman\u2019s <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/health\/\"   title=\"Health\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"1450\">health<\/a> is neglected, it ripples across her life, eroding her ability to work, to lead, and to dream. If India is to achieve its vision of an inclusive, empowered future, closing this gap must be central, not peripheral.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, public health strategies globally recognize that health is not an isolated sector but intricately linked to <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\"   title=\"Education\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2453\">education<\/a>, gender equity, nutrition, and women&#8217;s economic empowerment. India\u2019s aspirations under initiatives like\u00a0<strong>Anaemia Mukt Bharat<\/strong>,\u00a0<strong>Skill India<\/strong>,\u00a0<strong>Poshan Abhiyan<\/strong>, and\u00a0<strong>Digital Health India<\/strong>\u00a0align with this integrated vision. Yet on the ground, translation into meaningful change remains patchy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smile Foundation\u2019s\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/women-empowerment\/\">Swabhiman<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0programme steps into this gap \u2014 not as a stopgap solution, but as a systemic intervention focused on transforming both the conditions and the consciousness that limit women\u2019s futures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Health is more than the absence of illness<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the heart of Swabhiman lies a simple but radical idea: that good health for women is foundational to prosperity \u2014 personal and national. Bridging health inequities among women aligns with multiple&nbsp;<strong>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)<\/strong>: SDG 3 (Good Health and Wellbeing), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past year alone,\u00a0<strong>over 76,000 women<\/strong>\u00a0<strong>were sensitized on reproductive and child health <\/strong>through\u00a0door-to-door visits, community mobilization sessions, street plays, couple counseling, and more. These conversations went far beyond simple health messages; they challenged entrenched myths, sparked discussions on family planning, and encouraged early antenatal care \u2014 critical interventions considering that maternal mortality rates still hover at alarming levels in many Indian states.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover,\u00a0<strong>72,000 women\u00a0accessed real, tangible healthcare services via\u00a0health camps\u00a0and\u00a0telemedicine centres<\/strong>, receiving not only medical consultations but also\u00a0medicines, contraceptives, and sanitary napkins\u00a0\u2014 basic necessities that remain out of reach for too many.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Critically, Smile Foundation complements these direct services with <strong>Information, Education &amp; Communication (IEC) tools<\/strong>\u00a0that support broader government initiatives, creating scalable models for public-private partnership in health promotion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Nutrition as a lever of power<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Malnutrition is often treated as a statistic. But behind the numbers are women whose bodies are bearing the hidden costs of economic marginalization. Anaemia, low birth weights, stunted growth \u2014 these are not just health issues; they are systemic failings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recognizing this, Swabhiman focuses on\u00a0<strong>Sustainable Nutrition-Based Systems<\/strong>, enhancing community knowledge through practical demonstrations, health camps, and behavior change campaigns. Whether it is teaching the importance of\u00a0Diet Diversity\u00a0or emphasizing\u00a0Iron and Calcium Supplementation, the programme is preparing women not just to survive pregnancy and childbirth, but to thrive as healthy mothers, workers, and citizens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By building local leadership in nutrition, Swabhiman ensures that knowledge stays embedded in communities long after external interventions end.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Empowerment must include economic agency<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Health is necessary, but not sufficient. True empowerment requires the ability to generate income, make decisions, and assert autonomy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response, Smile Foundation has strategically integrated<strong> <\/strong>economic empowerment\u00a0into Swabhiman\u2019s framework. In the last year,\u00a0<strong>68 women-led micro-enterprises<\/strong>\u00a0were initiated. Women received business skills training,\u00a0financial literacy workshops, and seed capital support\u00a0to scale their ventures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a context where women\u2019s labor force participation has dropped to among the world\u2019s lowest rates \u2014 declining from\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/goatsandsoda\/2023\/01\/04\/1146953384\/why-women-in-india-are-dropping-out-the-workforce-even-as-the-economy-grows&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjJ7a_BxPqMAxXaTGwGHdP0Ad4QFnoECBcQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw36Z9q5NmPq6GDoGe52HdYx\">32% in 2005 to 19% in 2021<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0(World Bank data) \u2014 such interventions are about restoring women&#8217;s rightful place as economic actors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microenterprises started under Swabhiman span a range of sectors: tailoring units, food processing, beauty parlors, handicrafts, and more \u2014 each enterprise a living proof of resilience, ambition, and potential unleashed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Strengthening the system, not replacing it<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another key strength of Swabhiman is its commitment to&nbsp;<strong>system strengthening<\/strong>&nbsp;rather than parallel service delivery. Rather than operating in isolation, the programme&nbsp;<strong>builds capacities of frontline workers<\/strong>,&nbsp;<strong>upgrades wellness centres<\/strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>supports Anganwadi centres<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2014 integrating itself into the existing public health and social support ecosystem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in partnership with government agencies, Smile Foundation developed and shared new IEC materials on&nbsp;<strong>Nutrition<\/strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Anaemia<\/strong>, directly aiding frontline workers like ASHAs and Anganwadi workers in their vital outreach roles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach is crucial. No NGO, no matter how committed, can substitute for state capacity. By working to enhance it, Swabhiman creates multiplier effects, ensuring sustainability beyond individual programme cycles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Women&#8217;s empowerment is the economy&#8217;s empowerment<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is now well-established that empowering women economically could add trillions to global GDP. McKinsey Global Institute estimates that\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/featured-insights\/employment-and-growth\/how-advancing-womens-equality-can-add-12-trillion-to-global-growth\">$12 trillion<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0could be added to the world economy if gender gaps were closed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For India, the stakes are even higher. With an aging population on the horizon and a labor market hungry for skills, women are not just a &#8220;moral cause&#8221; \u2014 they are an economic imperative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smile Foundation\u2019s integrated model reaching over\u00a0<strong>190,000 women across six states<\/strong>\u00a0 is a microcosm of what needs to happen at scale. It offers proof that when health, nutrition, education, and economic opportunity are tackled together, transformation is possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this work cannot be confined to pilot projects and NGO initiatives alone. We need political will, corporate responsibility, and societal shifts to mainstream women\u2019s empowerment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A story still unfinished<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even as we celebrate these milestones, we must confront the enormous road still ahead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>59.1% of adolescent girls in India are anaemic (NFHS-5).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rural women access to skilled birth attendance still needs to be increased.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u0309\u030cOn the current trajectory, by 2050, women globally will still be spending almost 2.5 more hours per day on unpaid care work than men, affecting their ability to participate fully in the economy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Swabhiman\u2019s work shows what is possible through <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/corporate-partnership\/\"   title=\"Corporate Partnerships\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"405\">CSR<\/a> investments in education, health, infrastructure, and culture change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If India is serious about becoming a global leader \u2014 economically, diplomatically, morally \u2014 it must put its women at the center, not at the sidelines, of that journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Health is not charity. Empowerment is not optional. They are the engines of real, sustainable, inclusive development.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One vital segment continues to be overlooked in India&#8217;s concrete steps towards becoming developed by 20247: women who are still battling for basic health, dignity, and opportunity.
