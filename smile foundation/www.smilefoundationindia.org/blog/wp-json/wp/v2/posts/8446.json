And this stands true for the village <a href=\"https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/travel\/destinations\/piplantri-village-where-111-saplings-are-planted-every-time-a-girl-child-is-born\/articleshow\/108232431.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Piplantri in Rajasthan<\/a>. Whenever a girl child is born there, 111 saplings are planted. Since its start in Piplantri, this remarkable endeavour has shown positive effects on the local community. The tradition was initiated by the former village head, Shyam Sundar Paliwal, in 2007 to fight gender discrimination and environmental degradation.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For nearly 16 years, this tradition has prospered. About 50 girls are born each year, leading to the growth of over 400,000 trees. The birth of a daughter is now celebrated by the community. This initiative has not only contributed to the transformation of the desert area in Piplantri, but has also played a significant role in shifting the attitudes and mindsets of the community.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By empowering girls and women in a village, transforming the desert into a thriving green area and reducing droughts, the Piplantri campaign also effectively addresses the cultural and resource <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unwomen.org\/en\/news-stories\/explainer\/2022\/02\/explainer-how-gender-inequality-and-climate-change-are-interconnected\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">disparities that women encounter during disasters<\/a>. Let\u2019s examine how Paliwal&#8217;s simple idea ensured all this, contributing to a brighter future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Importance of Rooting For Girl Children<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a given that girls face numerous challenges, including discrimination, lack of access to <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\"   title=\"Education\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2209\">education<\/a> and gender-based violence. However, supporting and advocating for girl children uplifts them, benefits communities and economies at large.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many rural areas in India, Piplantri had skewed sex ratios and a cultural preference for boys. Paliwal sought to change this by celebrating the birth of girls and linking it to environmental conservation and a more sustainable future for the village. This shift in perception is crucial in changing societal attitudes towards girls, portraying them as bearers of prosperity and ecological balance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Ensuring Educational and Social Development for Girl Child in India<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>But it doesn&#8217;t stop there. Parents are expected to commit to educating their daughters and actively discourage child marriage. This aspect is critical as it guarantees that girls are provided with the chance to develop, acquire knowledge and emerge as empowered individuals. Education is a fundamental tool for breaking the cycle of poverty and discrimination. By guaranteeing education, this practice supports the all-around development of girl child in India.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Economic Benefits and Community Involvement<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The trees planted are often fruit-bearing or medicinal, providing an additional source of income for the families. This economic incentive further reinforces the value of the girl child, as her birth brings tangible benefits to the family. The entire community&#8217;s involvement in planting and nurturing the trees fosters a sense of collective responsibility and unity, strengthening social bonds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Holistic Empowerment<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, this practice exemplifies holistic empowerment by addressing both immediate and long-term needs of girl children. At the heart of this initiative lies a deep understanding that true empowerment goes beyond access to education\/economic opportunities. It requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the social, emotional and cultural barriers that girls often face. The community has come together to cultivate an environment where girls are celebrated, valued, supported and given the tools to thrive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This integrated approach sets a powerful example of how local customs can be harnessed to tackle global challenges such as gender inequality and climate change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Campaign for Ecofeminism&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Paliwal&#8217;s campaign has grown into a broader\u00a0ecofeminist movement. <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/ecofeminism\/\">Ecofeminism<\/a> is\u00a0important\u00a0as a political ideology, given its close association with climate change and the pressing global warming\u00a0crisis. Ecofeminism highlights the disproportionate impact of environmental issues on women and gender-variant individuals, attributing it to oppressive patriarchal structures. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As natural disasters become more frequent due to global warming, political scientists have identified several factors contributing to their disproportionate impact on women, such as a higher likelihood of women\u00a0living in poverty, limited\u00a0freedom of movement to mitigate the effects of environmental issues, being subjected to systematic violence and increased caregiving responsibilities. The growth of trees in Piplantri has increased the groundwater level and decreased droughts. Women&#8217;s cooperatives created employment opportunities, and there is a strong emphasis on girls&#8217; education and development, leading to positive community changes and a cultural shift benefiting women.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Model for Broader Adoption<\/strong> <strong>for Girl Child in India<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The success of the &#8220;111 saplings&#8221; tradition in Piplantri has the potential to inspire other regions to adopt similar practices. This model shows that grassroots initiatives, grounded in local culture and values, can create lasting change. This in turn contributes to a more equitable and sustainable world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, celebrating the birth of a girl child in Rajasthan serves as a powerful reminder of the positive impact that valuing and supporting girls can have on society and the environment. Initiatives for girls and women, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/\">Smile Foundation\u2019s<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/donate.smilefoundationindia.org\/donate-for-girl-child\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">She Can Fly<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/donate.smilefoundationindia.org\/women-empowerment\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Swabhiman<\/a> recognise the importance of education and gender equality as crucial to the well-being of nations, and also to their social and economic development. Supporting girls is not just a human rights issue; neglecting it undermines hard-earned development gains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Educating girl child transforms her life by providing her with the knowledge, skills and confidence needed to pursue her dreams. With access to education, girls can make informed decisions about their <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/health\/\"   title=\"Health\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"1237\">health<\/a>, career and future. This leads to greater personal independence and empowerment. They gain the ability to break free from the constraints of traditional roles, explore career options and achieve financial stability. Education opens doors to a world of possibilities, enabling girls to realise their full potential and live fulfilling, self-determined lives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Teamwork makes the dream work!
