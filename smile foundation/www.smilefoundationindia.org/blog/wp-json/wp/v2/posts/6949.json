In India, this endeavor is compounded by a healthcare system stretched beyond its capacity to cater to the unique requirements of these children. The educational landscape, still fixated on primary textbook education and exam scores, adds another layer of complexity. Additionally, a society influenced by superstitions often stigmatizes mental disorders by erroneously associating them with insanity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the more developed nations, the idea that regular schools should provide for specially-abled children as well has been around for more than  five decades, something that India is still to achieve. Smile Foundation in its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\">Mission Education (ME)<\/a> programme tries to cater to the needs of special children in remote areas of India. But there are organisations who are fully dedicated to the cause of differently-abled people like in the list <a href=\"https:\/\/thecsrjournal.in\/empowering-change-top-ngos-assisting-disabled-india-list\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Story of Subhashree<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My daughter Subhashree was born prematurely at 6 months and 8 days. Her birth weight was just 750 grams. When she didn&#8217;t cry, we had a doubt that she might have a problem,&#8221; recalls Subhashree&#8217;s concerned mother. At the age of five, Subhashree faced significant developmental delays. She couldn&#8217;t crawl, walk, or speak. The diagnosis came as a heavy blow\u2014 Cerebral Palsy. Her parents grappled with a sense of hopelessness about her future, unsure of how to navigate the complexities that lay ahead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her life took a transformative turn when she started going to a Smile center near her village in Puri, Odisha regularly. This center specializes in providing developmental therapy and life skills to special children, creating a supportive environment tailored to their unique needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Smile center became a safe space for Subhashree, offering her more than just therapy\u2014 it provided a community that understood, embraced, and nurtured her potential. Developmental therapy, personalized to address the specific challenges posed by Cerebral Palsy, became the starting point for change in her life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The center not only focused on therapeutic interventions but also emphasized the development of essential life skills. Subhashree, once confined by the limitations of her condition, began to experience newfound independence. Every small achievement became a monumental step forward\u2014 be it a supported walk, or the joyous expression of her thoughts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Subhashree&#8217;s journey reflects not just her resilience but also the unwavering support and determination of her family. Her parents found renewed strength and purpose through their daughter&#8217;s remarkable progress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Subhashree continues to defy expectations, her story stands as a testament to the transformative power of specialized care and support for children with special needs. Her story inspires us to celebrate the victories, both big and small, and highlights the importance of fostering inclusive environments where every child can thrive.

A true democraric spirit lies in making all things accessible, affordable and available for all. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;While disabled people are often presented as inspirational subjects in public spaces, their lives are still plagued by stigma and an indifferent social system.&#8221; writes Abhishek Annica, a writer and disability rights activist.
