This is achieved through education, healthcare, women empowerment and livelihood programmes. With the generous support of our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) partners, we have been able to extend our reach and impact, transforming communities. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, we highlight some of our best CSR partnerships that have supported our programmes and exemplified the spirit of giving and social responsibility. These CSR partnerships are a proof about what can be achieved when corporate entities collaborate with grassroots organisations to create meaningful change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. GlaxoSmithKline Asia Pvt Ltd.\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our partnership with GlaxoSmithKline Pvt. Ltd. has significantly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adgully.com\/glaxosmithkline-partners-with-smile-foundation-for-mobile-dental-units-124872.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">boosted our healthcare initiative<\/a>. Through this collaboration, GlaxoSmithKline, the maker of Sensodyne, and Smile Foundation have launched the \u201cSmile On Wheels&#8221; mobile medical units as part of their CSR initiative.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In India, 85-90% of adults and 60-80% of children suffer from dental issues. Acknowledging the urgent need for <strong>dental care<\/strong>, this initiative aims to improve oral <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/health\/\"   title=\"Health\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"1263\">health<\/a> in India by providing free dental consultations to underserved communities and enhancing access to dental care at the grassroots level. Equipped with a GPS facility and staffed by a registered dentist, technician and program coordinator, these mobile units are operated by Smile Foundation to raise awareness about oral health and hygiene and to increase access to oral healthcare services.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Berger Paints<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Berger Paints&#8217; partnership with Smile Foundation has made efforts towards enhancing entrepreneurial skills and employment opportunities for <strong>upskilling painters<\/strong> in India. Their support has been pivotal in our flagship program, &#8220;Smile Twin e-Learning Programme (STeP),&#8221; which provides <a href=\"https:\/\/ghamasan.com\/smile-foundation-and-berger-paints-have-brought-itrain-project-in-indore-sr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">training to the old and young painters<\/a> of our country to improve their skills through upskilling modules.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Berger Paints and Smile Foundation have jointly implemented the <strong>iTrain on Wheels<\/strong> Program, which trains painters in contemporary painting techniques. Besides facilitating the initiative, Smile Foundation will look after its monitoring and evaluation and impact assessment. This initiative has been crucial in creating numerous job and also entrepreneurial opportunities for painters across India.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. PepsiCo India<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>PepsiCo India has been a steadfast supporter of our nutrition enhancement initiatives. After the successful implementation of Project <em>Sampoorna<\/em>, a groundbreaking effort to combat anaemia and malnutrition among adolescent girls in Gujarat, PepsiCo and Smile Foundation joined hands to address the healthcare and nutrition needs of underserved communities in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. This very recent partnership focused on upgrading and strengthening Primary Health Centers (PHCs) and introducing a Nutrition Enhancement Programme.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They project installed state-of-the-art machines at <a href=\"https:\/\/indiacsr.in\/csr-pepsico-foundation-in-partnership-with-smile-foundation-inaugurated-model-anganwadi-centre\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">27 identified PHCs<\/a>. Additionally, the project includes collaborating with the government and conducting capacity-building sessions to ensure the effective use of these machines and the provision of quality healthcare to the rural populations with a focus on mother-child well-being, health and nutrition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Ericsson India<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ericsson India\u2019s collaboration with Smile Foundation has significantly strengthened our efforts to promote skill development and <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/livelihood\/\"   title=\"Livelihood\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"561\">livelihood<\/a> opportunities among youth of very low-income families. Since 2015, we have partnered with Ericsson India to operate 40 \u201cSmile Twin e-Learning Programme\u201d (STeP) centers across five cities: Delhi, Kolkata, Bangalore, Chennai, and Pune.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This partnership aims to train individuals in short technical courses, preparing them for roles such as general duty\/bedside assistants, patient care executives, front desk executives and telemarketers. By providing essential skills and training, we help these young individuals secure meaningful employment and build a brighter future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Aditya Birla Capital Foundation<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 2019, Smile Foundation\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adityabirla.com\/csr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">partnership with Aditya Birla Capital Foundation<\/a> has advanced education programs in the rural areas of Siddharthnagar and Shravasti of Uttar Pradesh. This collaboration aims to provide equitable access to quality <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\"   title=\"Education\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2238\">education<\/a> for children from poor socio-economic backgrounds. It is done through a four-pronged approach: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>building a child-centred <\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>teacher-centred learning environment<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>fostering community engagement <\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>and creating a supportive atmosphere for learning.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Major interventions include setting up digital classes with solar panel power backups and training teachers in pedagogy and digital media use. Efforts were also made to re-enroll students who dropped out during the COVID-19 pandemic and focus on educational recovery for children who missed schooling during the lockdown. This comprehensive approach ensures that every child has the opportunity to receive a quality education.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Avery Dennison<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Avery Dennison collaborated with Smile Foundation to empower women and adolescent girls in two villages of Gurugram, Haryana. Together, we launched a project titled \u201cEmpowering Women and Adolescent Girls Through Reproductive Health Education and Entrepreneurship Development\u201d under our <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/women-empowerment\/\"   title=\"Women Empowerment\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"459\">women empowerment<\/a> program, \u201cSwabhiman.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This initiative takes a community-focused, sustainable approach, aiming to enhance reproductive well-being by merging health and economic development efforts. It supports the establishment of group model enterprises, encouraging women to achieve financial independence by starting their own businesses. By integrating reproductive health education with entrepreneurship training, the project ensures a holistic and lasting impact on the community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. Philips India<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Philips India teamed up with Smile Foundation to improve access to quality primary healthcare services in Virudhunagar (Tamil Nadu), Gadag (Karnataka), Mewat (Haryana) and the Shirur Block of Pune. We deployed four mobile telemedicine units in these districts, which have been operational for the last five years.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These units are dedicated to delivering essential primary healthcare services to urban slums and rural areas. This initiative has made significant strides in enhancing the healthcare landscape of these regions. Through this partnership, we have brought much-needed medical support to underserved communities, ensuring better health outcomes for countless individuals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Celebrating CSR Partnerships and spreading smiles to the last mile<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Smile Foundation, we are incredibly proud of our CSR partnerships that have not only amplified our impact but have also set a benchmark for corporate social responsibility in India.
