Having lost her father to blood cancer, she saw her mother work tirelessly as a maid to support her and her younger sister. Determined to lighten her family\u2019s struggles, Vaitheeswari completed her M.Com and joined Smile Foundation\u2019s skill development training in Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI). Upon successful completion, she secured a position as an accountant in a reputed school, sharing:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cNow, I feel proud to share the responsibilities of my mother as well as my husband.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com\/docsz\/AD_4nXddHT6fxPrSqcMgN_vAkJpTVc8kswsG7c_WOyNHK9WLdKCW8vMVrwMLvoGUh10dpLKEEYqQsl_5OtuXGOlYf4V3TpoAO9OdL5vsGKVmhMH-XUElPz8Zr-lUPsPAv93VPE1PPWddYA?key=pE1Jyc00bJGbMpYUVU11M6kB\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Vaitheeswari busy with work at her workplace<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This initiative, which combines soft skills, technical training, and placement assistance, continues to transform the lives of underserved youth, equipping them for high-demand sectors like retail, healthcare, BPO, digital marketing, BFSI, and IT-ITES.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Project Manzil: Bridging Vocational Education and Employment<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In Rajasthan, <strong>Project Manzil<\/strong>, supported by IPE Global and implemented by Smile Foundation, has empowered over 50,000 girls from grades 9 to 12. The programme delivers counseling sessions addressing career opportunities, higher <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\"   title=\"Education\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2381\">education<\/a>, and personal growth. These sessions, many of which mark the girls&#8217; first exposure to structured vocational guidance, inspire them to envision ambitious futures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gulafsha\u2019s story<\/strong> exemplifies this impact. Raised in a struggling family of daily labourers, she received vocational training in retail and moved to Jaipur for a retail supermart job. Despite initial challenges, Gulafsha now contributes to her family\u2019s well-being and supports her siblings\u2019 education.

Through mobile iTrain vans, the programme has reached over 100 locations, providing hands-on training that enhances both technical skills and communication abilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2024, a special training session brought together drivers, supervisors, trainers, and applicators to refine their ability to deliver effective training sessions nationwide. By addressing communication barriers and ensuring content accessibility, the initiative empowers painters, including women, to enhance their employability and entrepreneurial potential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To celebrate these transformative journeys, Smile Foundation and Berger Paints launched a coffee table book, <strong>&#8220;From Canvas to Community&#8221;<\/strong>, featuring 12 inspiring stories of painters who turned their lives around through this programme.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com\/docsz\/AD_4nXddSB90Ccx6mSwh1FO7ZeA4r6FJHOy-pkUbm7u4jSahNwbrGzgJbANU3yzAXXd7NHd7N327Tb7FTAsi6O8obpKxdJhk3a7HslCevg_LhtVHKYppTSMygofWcOoZ4m-sF0Zin2Rb2w?key=pE1Jyc00bJGbMpYUVU11M6kB\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><strong>Recognition:<\/strong> Smile Foundation\u2019s iTrain on Wheels initiative received the \u201cBest Organisation of the Year in CSR Implementation\u201d award at the Bharat CSR &amp; Sustainability Conclave 2024, reflecting its success in uplifting thousands of painters and their families.<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Creating New Pathways: IT-ITES Focused Training<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In June 2024, Smile Foundation\u2019s STeP programme in Bengaluru introduced IT-ITES-focused courses in collaboration with NSDC and NASSCOM.
