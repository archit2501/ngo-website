The country transformed from predominantly being an agrarian economy to building manufacturing capabilities and a robust services industry. In this growth story, one thing that has played a crucial role is infrastructural development. From building roads and dams to establishing schools, hospitals, and railways, infrastructure has been the backbone of India&#8217;s progress, driving economic growth, and improving quality of life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Owing to the vision of our founding fathers, India invested heavily in infrastructural development in the decades following independence. This included the expansion of national highways and railway networks, the building of <strong>major dams like Bhakra Nangal<\/strong>, and the establishment of premium institutions like the IITs and AIIMS. In recent decades, we have also seen a focus on urban infrastructure development with projects like Metro Rail, tunnels, and much more. Thus, as India enters a new era, it needs to continue focusing on building stronger infrastructural capabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Infrastructural Needs for India<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many areas in which India can focus. But, here are a few key areas that require consistent attention for the holistic development of Indian urban as well as rural communities:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Road Network: <\/strong>For any economy to grow, mobility of movement is most important. This is why expanding a robust road network in the form of national and state highways, expressways, etc., needs to be a priority. India&#8217;s ambitious <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.india.gov.in\/spotlight\/bharatmala-pariyojana-stepping-stone-towards-new-india\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bharatmala Pariyojana<\/a><\/em> aims to develop 83,677 kilometres of highways, improving connectivity in remote and underserved regions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dams<\/strong>: As the requirements of the country\u2019s growing population increase, there will be a bigger need for water management, electricity generation, irrigation facilities, and much more. This is where building new dams can be a game-changer. Apart from that, India is also focusing on river-linking projects aimed at diverting water from areas that experience flooding to those areas that are affected by drought.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Educational Institutions: <\/strong>The Indian government has been working sincerely towards expanding the number of AIIMS and IITs in the country. In addition, <strong>new universities, schools, and colleges need to be built.<\/strong> Existing institutions also need an infrastructural boost in the form of smart upgrades to make them relevant.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hospitals: <\/strong>A large part of the Indian population is deprived, even today, of good quality healthcare facilities, as most of the big hospitals are concentrated in urban areas<strong> forcing rural and tribal populations to flock to cities like Chandigarh, Delhi, Hyderabad, etc.,<\/strong> for receiving adequate health support. However, this is not sustainable, and the country needs to work on expanding its healthcare network. This can also be done through the development of digital infrastructure like telemedicine facilities, mobile hospitals, etc.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Railways:<\/strong> This is arguably the lifeline of India; even today because of the reach and affordability, lakhs of Indians travel through railways. This is the reason why the government must keep pushing for the expansion of railways in regions where it hasn\u2019t yet reached. The recent expansion of the railway network to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/news\/national\/on-republic-day-eve-vande-bharat-express-touches-base-in-kashmir-for-first-time\/article69140341.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Srinagar in Kashmir <\/a>and the building of the world&#8217;s highest railway bridge is a good example of it. Apart from this, another way of improving the mobility of Indians is by building more airports across the country and making air travel affordable for the masses.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Other infrastructure: <\/strong>In addition to roads, dams, schools, hospitals, and railways, other critical infrastructure includes airports, ports, and digital connectivity. Developing world-class airports and ports can boost trade and tourism, while expanding digital infrastructure ensures access to information and services, bridging the digital divide.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Needs and Aspirations<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As India continues to grow and evolve, it is essential to focus on the future needs and aspirations of the population. Here are some key areas where India should continue investing in infrastructure:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sustainable Development:<\/strong> While developing infrastructure is essential, what is also needed is a focus on sustainability. As India moves forward, it also needs to play an important role in establishing itself as a climate-conscious nation. Therefore, the country should focus on investing in <strong>environment-friendly practices and investing in renewable energy.<\/strong> India is already on the path of building these capabilities. It needs to continue building on these efforts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Healthcare expansion: <\/strong>As discussed above, India still faces a major challenge when it comes to providing equitable access to good quality healthcare facilities to its population. The COVID-19 pandemic also revealed many loopholes in India\u2019s healthcare infrastructure. There, it is essential that all the stakeholders work together in building facilities for all Indians. Digital solutions are going to play a crucial role in this. Policies like universal health insurance are also going to ease the burden on the poorer masses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Digital connectivity<\/strong>: Expanding digital infrastructure is critical for bridging the digital divide and ensuring access to information and services. Initiatives like Digital India aim to provide high-speed internet connectivity to rural and remote areas, enabling digital literacy, e-governance, and digital financial inclusion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Educational Infrastructure: <\/strong>Investing in educational infrastructure at all levels, from primary schools to higher education institutions, is essential for fostering innovation and human capital development. Enhancing vocational training centers and skill development programs can equip the workforce in India with the necessary skills for a rapidly changing job market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transportation and logistics: <\/strong>Developing efficient transportation and logistics infrastructure can boost trade and economic growth. Expanding the railway network, modernizing ports and airports, and improving last-mile connectivity are critical for enhancing India&#8217;s competitiveness in the global market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For major economies like the United States, Europe, China, etc., infrastructural development has played a central role in their development and growth. These countries continue to invest heavily in further enhancing their capabilities. For example, China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative is aimed at establishing its dominance in trade around the world. Similarly, Japan\u2019s focus on technology has made it a leader in this area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As India continues its journey towards becoming a global economic powerhouse, investing in infrastructure remains a critical priority. By focusing on sustainable development, healthcare, digital connectivity, education, and transportation, India can build a stronger and more resilient nation that meets the needs and aspirations of its people. Infrastructural development is not just about building physical structures; it is about creating opportunities, improving quality of life, and fostering social and economic progress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Smile\u2019s Contribution<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Smile Foundation helps develop infrastructure primarily by improving <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\">education <\/a>and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/health\/\">healthcare<\/a> facilities in underserved areas.
