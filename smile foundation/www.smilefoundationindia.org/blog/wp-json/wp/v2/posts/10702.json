The number stands as high as 976 individuals and 28 organizations after deducting redundancy. But are you aware that the number of women who bagged the award remains critically low? The number is just 65. The number shrinks to 25 if we calculate the number of women who bagged awards in science\u2014physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the gender gap in the field, we also need to acknowledge that there has been a study raise in the number of girls in science. And, it always calls for celebration. Only by celebrating women who reach the pinnacle of their scientific careers can we encourage girls in school to take up science. Else, they go back to their cages without defying gender stereotypes. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why are girls in STEM always good news?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>People, quite often, question when the world celebrates a woman who reaches the top of her scientific career more than a man. It is simply because men are freely allowed to concentrate on their careers and personal growth. But for women, a career is just one of the numerous things that she needs to focus on. Often, women were forced to put a full stop to their careers and personal growth to excel in other things. That\u2019s why the recognition of women in science is celebrated as good news. Below are some of the reasons why our hearts ache to see much more good news.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Challenging stereotypes:<\/strong> Historically, women have been discouraged from pursuing a career, especially in STEM. It has always been seen as a career option for men. Even those who fight odds are allowed to take up only caregiving jobs like nursing, teaching, sewing, and mending. As a result, the field has always been underrepresented by women. When a woman excels in the field, it means that she has challenged outdated stereotypes and gender biases. Her achievements demonstrate that talent and innovation are not bound by gender.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Inspiring future generations:<\/strong> When young girls witness women succeeding in science, they change their perspective. It will help them to break down the mental barriers that had discouraged them from pursuing such careers or defying gender stereotypes. Role models will significantly influence a person\u2019s choices, and seeing women in prominent science roles encourages more diverse participation in fields traditionally dominated by men.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Diverse perspectives lead to better innovation:<\/strong> Studies have proved that diversity\u2014people from different backgrounds, genders, cultures, and experiences\u2014will lead to creative problem-solving and innovation. When multiple angles are given to a problem, a wider range of potential solutions can be arrived at earlier. This in turn can result in more creative and well-rounded innovations. In a similar way, women would have a unique perspective and approach to research. It in turn will lead to breakthroughs that may have been overlooked otherwise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Equality and empowerment:<\/strong> When a woman succeeds in science, she inspires a lot of girls to pursue science. This in turn paves the path not only for women&#8217;s empowerment but also for ensuring equality in the field. Since women will help shift the culture in academia, research institutions, and industries, these spaces will also become more inclusive and open to future generations of scientists, regardless of gender.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Facts and figures about women in science<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are some of the facts and figures about women in science as listed by the United Nations and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Only one in three scientists across the globe are women.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Less than two out of five STEM graduates are women. Women account for just 28% of engineering graduates and 40% in computer science and informatics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Women hold just 22% of STEM jobs in G20 countries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Only 12% of national academies of science members are women.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. The percentage of women scientists has gone up to 31.7% in 2021 from 30% in 2017 worldwide. The percentage still remains in South and West Asia in the last decade.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. There is not much improvement in analyzing and gathering data regarding the share of female researchers in the last decade. Not all countries have reliable data on gender and science.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. One in two women scientists has reported experiencing sexual harassment at the workplace, as per a 2022 study.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8. Only one in five professionals, i.e., just 22%, are women in cutting-edge fields, including artificial intelligence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9. The gender gap continues to widen as women advance in their scientific careers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10. Women are given smaller research grants than their counterparts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11. Only 25 women scientists have bagged the Nobel Prize to date. Of which, Marie Curie remains the only woman who bagged the award twice\u2014physics in 1903 and chemistry in 1911.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Ways to close the gender gap in science<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the evident progress women have made in science, the gender gap continues to exist, and men dominate the field without much difficulty. Closing the historical gender gap requires a multi-faceted approach to help women tackle numerous barriers throughout their academic and professional careers. Below are some of the ways to help reduce the gender gap.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Encourage early STEM <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\"   title=\"Education\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2421\">education<\/a> for girls:<\/strong> Materials that often portray male examples of scientists and engineers and women depicted as teachers and nurses should be removed from school books. Since people\u2019s aspirations are framed from an early age, including gender-neutral language in textbooks, lectures, and scientific papers becomes vital. Family members and teachers should encourage girls to explore their interest in science, even as they assist them to challenge societal stereotypes. To spark interest and confidence in young girls, they should be encouraged to engage with STEM activities from an early age. Girls should be allowed to participate in programmes like coding clubs, science fairs, and robotic competitions without any gender-based restrictions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Mentorship and networking:<\/strong> Most of the time, girls opt out of pursuing careers because they don\u2019t get the right support at the right time. The field does not have many mentorship programmes that are tailored to support girls. Since many are not allowed to travel out of their city to attend mentorship programmes or broaden their networking connections, they lack mentorship opportunities. This often puts women with less or no mentorship. Also networking space has historically been dominated by men and it has always been aligned with the interests and priorities of men. When a woman enters the male-dominated domain, she is often looked down upon. Without proper guidance and a lack of networks, women often stall before collapsing completely. By offering mentorship and networking opportunities, a greater number of girls can be brought into the field. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Retaining women in the workforce:<\/strong> Even as we work towards bringing in more girls into science, we should also put equal effort into retaining women in the workforce by addressing their challenges. Women in the workforce are often paid less, and have few chances of getting promotion. The World Bank suggests, \u201cpolicies that encourage retention such as flexible work, paid family leave, and childcare support will benefit both women, men, and employers and are particularly crucial.\u201d By retaining women, we are not just moving towards gender equality at the workplace but also encouraging numerous other girls to pursue careers in the field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Smile\u2019s Work<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Smile Foundation has been actively promoting STEM education among girls, recognizing the importance of bridging the gender gap in these fields. In collaboration with various partners, the foundation has launched several initiatives to empower young women in STEM.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Engineering Scholarship Programs:<\/strong> Smile Foundation, in partnership with organizations like Deutsche Bank, Quantiphi, Quest Global, and Siemens, offers scholarship programs targeting female engineering students. These programs provide financial assistance, essential learning tools such as laptops, employability and communication training, internships, and industry exposure. Currently, over 2,000 students benefit from these initiatives, aiming to increase female representation in high-growth sectors.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>STEM Labs and Mobile Learning:<\/strong> In collaboration with BMW India Foundation, Smile Foundation has established state-of-the-art STEM laboratories in government-aided schools across Delhi NCR. Additionally, a &#8216;STEM on Wheels&#8217; mobile lab has been introduced to reach students in smaller community schools. These labs are equipped with modern tools and technologies, providing hands-on learning experiences to foster creativity and problem-solving skills among students. This initiative engages around 2,500 students annually, promoting inclusivity in STEM fields, particularly for underprivileged children.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through these initiatives, Smile Foundation is actively working to empower girls in STEM, providing them with the necessary resources, support, and opportunities to excel in these fields.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the progress made in the field, science is still dominated by men. To include more women in the field and walk towards gender equality, the workspace needs to become more inclusive, girls should be exposed to STEM at an early age, and societal stereotypes should be challenged without apologies. For this to happen, the world needs to celebrate the women in science, and it should always remain good news.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do you know that the Nobel Prize, one of the prestigious awards bestowed to those who conferred the greatest benefits to humankind, was bestowed 627 times to 1,012 people and organizations between 1901 and 2024?
