This where the role of community mobilizers comes in. They are a vital part of the healthcare system as they are often the first point of contact or information related to health, vaccinations, and so on. This includes both Anganwadi and ASHA workers.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Anganwadi and ASHA workers<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>ASHA workers come under the ambit of India\u2019s National Rural <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/health\/\"   title=\"Health\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"933\">Health<\/a> Mission. They act as the first point of contact for any health-related issue in rural areas. The most marginalized communities in the country depend on ASHA workers for doorstep healthcare services. The women who work as ASHA workers have played a huge part in bringing down maternal and infant mortality rates. They inform and educate the communities, right from pregnancy, to childbirth, lactation, and even after that. Moreover, ASHA workers also help marginalized women with institutional deliveries. As per the scheme, every village in the country must have an ASHA worker. This is a trained female community health activist who belongs to the village itself. She is accountable to the people and works as an interface between the community and the public health system.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Anganwadi workers primarily work on nutrition of children. They come under the umbrella of Integrated Child Development Services of the government.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Even amid the pandemic, this force of community mobilizers played a large role in informing, educating, and collecting data. They have also been at the forefront of many immunization initiatives over the years. During the pandemic, they were responsible for contact tracing as well as ensuring that migrant workers quarantined properly.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>What all services do community mobilizers provide?<\/h2>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/transition-of-anganwadi-centres-to-child-friendly-learning-spaces\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Anganwadi\u00a0<\/a>and ASHA workers are responsible for a number of nutrition and healthcare services.

These include basic sanitation and hygiene (promoting WASH), healthy living conditions, balanced nutrition, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>Counsel women over the course of their pregnancy and after childbirth. They educate women about birth preparedness, institutional delivery, breastfeeding, immunization of the child, contraception, and prevention of common infections.<\/p>\n<p>Facilitate the community\u2019s access to health-related institutional services.<\/p>\n<p>Provisions essential items like oral rehydration solution and so on.<\/p>\n<h4>Anganwadi<\/h4>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Elicit community support and participation in various programmes.<\/p>\n<p>Carry out surveys with special focus on mothers and children.<\/p>\n<p>Organise non-formal pre-school activities for children.<\/p>\n<p>Educate mothers about\u00a0supplementary nutrition.<\/p>\n<p>Provide health and nutrition <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\"   title=\"Education\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"1793\">education<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Conduct home visits to educate parents about the growth and development of their children.<\/p>\n<p>Keep track of possible outbreaks of diseases such as cholera.<\/p>\n<p>Guide ASHAs in carrying out their responsibilities and in maintaining records.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Why are community mobilizers crucial to the healthcare infrastructure?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The responsibilities of ASHAs and Anganwadis listed above make it clear that they are at the frontline of the healthcare infrastructure of rural areas and even in urban villages.
