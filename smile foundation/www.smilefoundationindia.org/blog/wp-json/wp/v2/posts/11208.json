Dr. Panda, can you take us back to the beginning \u2014 what personal experience first made you realise that deaf children need a different kind of <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\"   title=\"Education\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2461\">education<\/a> system?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Panda: <\/strong>I lost my hearing when I was just 10 years old. I was always a curious child, eager to learn and engage with the world around me. But after my hearing loss, I faced a huge challenge in trying to continue my education. The mainstream schools I attended weren\u2019t equipped to accommodate a deaf child. No one spoke sign language, and I struggled to understand what the teachers were saying, but it was better than the special children school that I tried attending. Still, the whole experience was quite isolating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, my elder brother was also deaf, so he helped me navigate this new world. I started learning sign language at home, but it wasn\u2019t until I entered the Delhi Foundation for Deaf Women that I truly found my voice. That\u2019s when I began to realise just how limited the opportunities were for deaf students \u2014 not just in terms of education but in society as a whole. I saw firsthand how my peers, despite their intelligence and potential, were constantly underestimated because they couldn\u2019t hear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was that realization that pushed me to do something about it. I wanted to create an educational space where deaf children could thrive, feel understood and supported. My journey led me to meet Professor Ulrike Zeeshan, a German linguist, who helped me document Indian Sign Language (ISL). I became the first person in India to do so, and with her help, we created the first ISL course, which is still used by institutions today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, I see my work as a way to give other deaf children the opportunities I never had. I\u2019ve spent my life working towards a future where no child has to struggle the way I did. The journey continues, but it\u2019s been a rewarding one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q2. What makes Happy Hands unique compared to traditional schools for the deaf?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Panda: <\/strong>We\u2019re a deaf-led, deaf-focused community. Every teacher here knows Indian Sign Language (ISL). Most are deaf themselves. Our curriculum is bilingual and bicultural, meaning students learn both ISL and written language. We don\u2019t rely on one-size-fits-all methods. We use deaf multi-literacies, peer-to-peer teaching, activity-based learning, and a lot of visual storytelling. Our aim isn\u2019t just to teach\u2014it&#8217;s to empower children to think critically and build their identities with pride.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q3. How does Happy Hands integrate ecology with education? Why is it important?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Panda:<\/strong> At Happy Hands, we believe that education should not just focus on academic subjects, but also on nurturing the whole child \u2014 their connection to the environment, their understanding of sustainability, and their role in the world around them. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve intentionally woven ecology into our curriculum, making it an integral part of our students\u2019 learning experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We start by introducing the concept of ecology early. For example, our students engage in hands-on projects where they directly interact with nature. We have a garden at the school, where students plant vegetables and herbs. They learn not just how to grow food, but also about the delicate balance of ecosystems. They see firsthand how plants, insects, water, and soil all play important roles in maintaining life. These lessons are enriched with sign language, ensuring that every concept is accessible, visual, and deeply understood by the children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ecology is a theme that runs through various subjects. In science, we explore topics like biodiversity, climate change, and renewable energy. Our students take field trips to local ecosystems \u2014 whether it&#8217;s a wetland, a forest, or an urban park \u2014 where they experience the real-world application of what they\u2019ve learned. By connecting theory with practice, we\u2019re teaching them to respect and protect the environment from an early age.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also focus on the ethical side of ecology. Through discussions and activities, we teach our students about the importance of reducing waste, conserving resources, and advocating for a cleaner, more sustainable planet. They\u2019re involved in projects like recycling drives and learning to reduce plastic use at school. The students understand that their actions can have a positive impact on the world around them, and that ecological conservation is something they can actively contribute to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q4. Can you elaborate on the activity-based learning approach at Happy Hands?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Panda:<\/strong> Deaf children are highly visual learners. Also, we believe that learning should be interactive and engaging.&nbsp;Our activity-based approach involves using games, practical exercises, and real-life scenarios to teach various subjects.&nbsp;For instance, students might learn mathematics through measuring ingredients for a recipe or understand science concepts by observing plant growth in our gardens.&nbsp;This method caters to the visual learning strengths of deaf students and makes education a more enjoyable and meaningful experience.<a href=\"https:\/\/happyhands.org\/deaf-christian-academy.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q5: What role do deaf teachers play at Happy Hands, and why is that representation important?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Panda:<\/strong> When I was growing up, I never had a deaf teacher. I didn\u2019t see anyone like me at the front of a classroom. It was always someone who didn\u2019t sign, didn\u2019t understand what it was like to be deaf in a hearing world. That kind of isolation does something to a child \u2014 it makes you question your own potential. That\u2019s why, when I started Happy Hands, I made a conscious decision: our classrooms would have deaf teachers. Not just as a token gesture, but as the core of our pedagogy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a child sees someone like them teaching science, leading a farm activity, or coding on a computer, it sends a very different message than when they\u2019re simply trying to keep up in a classroom designed for hearing kids. Representation like that builds confidence. It creates belonging. It helps our students internalise that being deaf doesn\u2019t mean being limited.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deaf teachers teach with cultural fluency. They know how to communicate without needing to \u2018translate.\u2019 They teach in sign language directly, without interpreters. That fluency means learning happens faster, more naturally. They also bring their lived experience, which is something no textbook can teach. But here\u2019s the problem: we don\u2019t have enough deaf teachers in India because we haven\u2019t created enough opportunities for deaf people to become teachers. That\u2019s a systemic failure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we\u2019re trying to change that \u2014 by mentoring our students, by advocating for teacher training programmes in sign language, by building pathways that never existed for us. Because the next generation deserves more than what we had. We need more deaf educators who can not only teach but advocate for the deaf community in every classroom, every institution, and every sector.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q6: How has Indian Sign Language evolved over the years, and what still needs to be done?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Panda:<\/strong> Indian Sign Language (ISL) has come a long way, but it\u2019s still not where it should be. I\u2019ve seen the progress myself, especially in the last two decades. When I first started documenting ISL, it was practically invisible. There was no formal structure, no accepted curriculum, and no real understanding of the language as a complete, rich system of communication. It wasn\u2019t even recognized as a language in its own right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, however, more people began to see the importance of ISL. With the establishment of the ISL Research and Training Centre (ISLRTC) and growing awareness from private and public institutions, there\u2019s been a shift in how people view the language. It\u2019s slowly gaining recognition. More schools are teaching ISL, and more individuals are learning it as a second language.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there\u2019s still so much work to be done. For example, ISL is still not recognised as an official language of India, and that\u2019s something the government needs to address. The deaf community continues to fight for this recognition, yet we are often met with resistance. Language recognition is about giving a community access to the same rights and opportunities as everyone else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the gap in education for deaf children is still stark. Many schools don\u2019t have teachers proficient in ISL, and interpreters are still too few and far between. The challenges of inclusive education in India are huge, and they stem from a lack of understanding about what inclusive education truly means for deaf students. We need to prepare deaf students with the same academic skills as hearing students from an early age, and that\u2019s a long-term process. But we\u2019re not there yet. The pace of change is slow, and that\u2019s why we must keep pushing for systemic reform \u2014 in policy, education, and awareness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are, however, seeing positive changes on the social front. People are beginning to appreciate the rich culture that ISL represents. I believe in the next few years, we will see even more momentum \u2014 we have no choice but to keep moving forward. But there\u2019s still a long way to go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q7: How important is the involvement of the deaf community in shaping policies for Deaf education?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Panda:<\/strong> The involvement of the deaf community in shaping policies for deaf education is absolutely critical. Too often, education policies are made by people who are not deaf, who don\u2019t understand the lived experience, and who have never navigated the world from a deaf perspective. This leads to policies that are well-meaning but ultimately ineffective. That\u2019s why the deaf community must be involved at every step of the process \u2014 from curriculum design to teacher training to advocacy for government funding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve personally seen how vital it is to have deaf voices at the table. When I was involved in the early efforts to promote ISL, one of the challenges we faced was that many policy discussions about deaf education were happening without any input from deaf individuals themselves. The policies being discussed weren\u2019t addressing the core issues we faced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why I pushed to make sure that deaf people were involved in the development of the curriculum and the training of teachers. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve been part of discussions where non-deaf people suggested \u201csolutions\u201d for the deaf community that were completely disconnected from our needs. We need deaf-led advocacy to ensure that we are fighting for the right things. We need deaf individuals in leadership positions, shaping the conversations around policy, not just being the subjects of those policies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can say from experience that when the deaf community is included in decision-making, the results are far more effective. Policies that come from the community are not only more inclusive, but they also reflect the true needs of deaf individuals. It\u2019s not just about creating the right laws; it\u2019s about creating a culture that values deaf people and understands the challenges they face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the Digital Sign Language Library project, which I worked on with other deaf leaders, was a perfect example of what can happen when deaf people lead the charge. We created a resource that was designed specifically for the needs of deaf students and teachers. The information has to be meaningful and accessible to the people it\u2019s meant to serve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q8: What role does technology play in bridging the gap for deaf students in education, and what advancements would you like to see in the future?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Panda:<\/strong> When I started my career in deaf education, the resources available to deaf children were limited. There were no accessible learning platforms, no specialised apps for sign language, and certainly no online resources that catered to the unique needs of deaf students. But as technology has advanced, it has opened up new possibilities for bridging the gap in education.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we\u2019re still in the early stages of what\u2019s possible. The next frontier is the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) in deaf education. Imagine a VR classroom where deaf students can interact with 3D models and simulations in sign language, or AI-based tools that can translate speech to sign language in real-time, enabling deaf students to participate in mainstream classes seamlessly. These are the kinds of advancements I\u2019m excited about because they have the potential to eliminate many of the barriers that deaf students currently face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are challenges. Many schools, particularly in rural areas, lack the infrastructure and resources to implement these technologies. Additionally, there\u2019s still a need for more research and development in the field of assistive technologies for the deaf. While we\u2019ve made progress, there\u2019s a lot more that can be done to make learning truly accessible and inclusive for deaf children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the future, I hope we can see a world where technology levels the playing field for all students \u2014 deaf or hearing. But for that to happen, we need continued investment in both the development of technology and the training of educators to use it effectively. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q9: How has the partnership with Smile Foundation supported Happy Hands, and why do you think such collaborations matter?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Panda:<\/strong> The partnership with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\"><strong>Smile Foundation<\/strong><\/a> has been a real turning point for us. The support is financial, strategic and empathetic. They understand that deaf education needs more than classrooms. That it needs awareness, training, and community engagement. With their help, we&#8217;ve been able to build better infrastructure, develop teaching materials in Indian Sign Language, and provide more consistent support for our deaf teachers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I appreciate most is that Smile Foundation doesn\u2019t try to \u2018fix\u2019 things from the outside. They listen. They ask how they can strengthen what already exists. That\u2019s rare. Many organisations come in with their own models and expect you to adapt. But Smile has partnered with us in a way that respects our philosophy and amplifies our impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Partnerships like this are essential because no one institution can transform deaf education alone. We need allies who believe in the long-term change we&#8217;re working towards. Smile Foundation is one of those rare allies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q10: What do you think needs to change in society to create a more inclusive environment for deaf people?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Panda:<\/strong> The most important thing that needs to change in society is the mindset around deafness. We\u2019ve been taught to see Deafness as a \u201cdisability\u201d or a \u201climitation,\u201d when in reality, it\u2019s just a different way of experiencing the world. For too long, society has treated deaf people as if they\u2019re lesser or in need of fixing, when in fact, deaf individuals have the same intellectual capacity, creativity, and potential as anyone else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I often think about how we create spaces that truly value deaf people. The first step is understanding that accessibility is a right, not a privilege. There needs to be a cultural shift where deafness is not just accepted, but celebrated. We need to normalise sign language in daily life, ensure that public spaces have the right accessibility features (like sign language interpreters at public events, captioning on TV shows, and accessible government services), and integrate deaf individuals into all aspects of society.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But more than anything, we need to change the narrative. We need to stop framing deafness as something that needs to be \u201cfixed\u201d and start seeing it as part of the beautiful diversity of human experience. Once we make that shift, we\u2019ll see a true, lasting change in how deaf people are treated, included, and empowered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q11: How can parents support their deaf child\u2019s development at home?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Panda:<\/strong> Supporting a deaf child at home begins with creating an environment where the child feels seen, heard, and valued. For many parents of deaf children, there\u2019s an initial fear or uncertainty about how to communicate. They may feel like they\u2019re missing out on some fundamental connection with their child, but in reality, the key to support is simple: communication and interaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing I always tell parents is to learn sign language. When parents sign with their children, they are opening up an entire world of communication that would otherwise be closed off. This doesn\u2019t just mean teaching them basic signs, but engaging in everyday conversation \u2014 talking about feelings, asking about their day, discussing the world around them. It\u2019s about building a language-rich environment, even at home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond language, parents can also create a supportive home environment by fostering independence and self-expression. Encouraging their child to try new things \u2014 whether it\u2019s drawing, reading, playing a musical instrument, or exploring the outdoors \u2014 is crucial. It\u2019s also important to celebrate achievements, no matter how small, to boost the child\u2019s confidence and self-esteem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key takeaway is that the home should be a place where a deaf child feels fully embraced. When parents take the time to understand their child\u2019s needs and adapt their own communication methods, they\u2019re setting the stage for a lifelong, positive relationship. The development of a deaf child happens most powerfully in the context of a supportive family, and it\u2019s beautiful to see how far they can go when that foundation is laid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q12: What advice would you give to parents of deaf children, especially those who are unsure about which path to take for their child\u2019s education?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Panda:<\/strong> My advice to parents of deaf children is simple: trust in the potential of your child. From the moment a child is born, they have the ability to learn, grow and thrive. Give them the tools they need to do exactly that. For a deaf child, the most important tool is language, and that language should be Indian Sign Language. If they don\u2019t have language, they can\u2019t fully engage with the world around them. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so critical for parents to choose early intervention programmes that focus on providing deaf children with access to ISL right from the start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of education, I would encourage parents to explore options beyond the mainstream school system. There\u2019s a lot of resistance in traditional schools when it comes to deaf children, but there are also specialised schools and programmes that cater specifically to deaf children, like Happy Hands, that create a supportive, inclusive environment. Look for schools that offer a bilingual education \u2014 where deaf children can learn in ISL and also be exposed to written language \u2014 because this will give them the best chance for success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But above all, don\u2019t let anyone tell you that your child\u2019s dreams are limited by their deafness. Deaf children can be anything they want to be \u2014 doctors, engineers, artists \u2014 as long as we, as a society, provide them with the right education, support, and opportunities. The only limitation is the lack of belief in their potential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, always remember: your child\u2019s journey is unique, and it\u2019s okay to take your time finding what works best for them. Surround them with people who believe in them and advocate for their rights, because no one else will do it as passionately as you will.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In rural Odisha, Dr. Sibaji Panda, a deaf educator and Indian Sign Language (ISL) advocate, has created Happy Hands School for the Deaf.
