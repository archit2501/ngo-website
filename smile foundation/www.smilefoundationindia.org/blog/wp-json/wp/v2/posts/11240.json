Bamboo, once an overlooked resource, is now at the center of a transformative movement\u2014thanks to the determination of local artisans and the quiet power of partnerships. Leading this revival is the Bamboo Resource Center (BRC), a grassroots NGO working to preserve traditional craftsmanship and uplift rural livelihoods. But what sets this story apart is not just the mission\u2014it\u2019s the method.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bamboo Resource Center&#8217;s journey toward self-reliance and sustainability has been significantly strengthened through its involvement in Smile Foundation\u2019s&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/ctgi\/\">Empowering Grassroots<\/a><\/strong>&nbsp;initiative, supported by&nbsp;Change the Game Academy. This collaboration has done more than improve financial inflows or polish communication\u2014it has sparked a shift in mindset. It has helped small NGOs like BRC understand their power, their role, and most importantly, their potential to thrive independently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Reviving a traditional craft<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bamboo, often termed &#8220;green gold,&#8221; holds immense potential in India&#8217;s rural economy.&nbsp;The country&#8217;s bamboo market was valued at approximately USD 5.84 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 8.35 billion by 2030, growing at a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grandviewresearch.com\/horizon\/outlook\/bamboos-market\/india?\">CAGR of 4.6%<\/a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;Despite this, many artisans remain marginalised, lacking access to markets and modern techniques.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haridas Nair, founder of Bamboo Resource Center, reflects on the beginnings: \u201cThe objective was to promote bamboo artisans and provide them with a platform to sell their handcrafted articles. Funding then became a crucial need to run the organization.\u201d His words reveal a common struggle for community-based organisations (CBOs): immense local potential constrained by limited access to institutional knowledge and sustainable financing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>From capacity building to collective strength<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Recognising this gap, the&nbsp;Empowering Grassroots&nbsp;training intervened not just as a support system but as a catalyst for systemic change. Manjusha Khedkar, a trainer with the initiative, explains: \u201cI observed that there are small grassroots-level NGOs who really need to develop their capacities\u2014not only to raise funds, but how to communicate in the community, how to involve the community in their program.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This insight became the foundation of a training model tailored to the actual needs of local NGOs. It was not a prescriptive, top-down solution. Instead, it encouraged the identification of real, local problems and supported NGOs in designing their own responses. Manjusha describes the process as a \u201clifelong lesson\u201d\u2014for both trainers and trainees. \u201cAs a trainer, I feel the best part of CtGA and&nbsp;Empowering Grassroots&nbsp;is that the training does not end at training, but post-training mentorship is very crucial. It\u2019s a learning process for us as well as for them.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, the results are evident. The Bamboo Resource Center, once primarily focused on artisan support, has now evolved into a learning hub for market readiness and community-led development. Its members are not only selling products but also building systems\u2014supply chains, communication plans, and fundraising strategies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Narratives of change<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Advisors like Anil Harpude highlight how the initiative has redefined the very structure of opportunity for artisans. \u201cThere are many skilled artisans, but they lacked proper training and knowledge of urban market demands,\u201d he notes. Training modules helped bridge this gap\u2014equipping artisans not only with better tools and techniques but also with an understanding of how to position their craft in contemporary markets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Equally important was the introduction of the concept of local fundraising. As Umesh Sonune, Programme Manager at BRC, shares, \u201cLocal fundraising was a new concept for us. But through the training, we learned new aspects\u2026 it\u2019s about engaging people, building relationships, and integrating them into our initiatives.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The nuance here is critical: fundraising might start with looking for money but is really about trust, engagement, and long-term partnerships with the very community an NGO serves. As Smile Foundation and CtGA emphasised throughout the training, ownership lies at the local level. By decentralising dependency and promoting autonomy, the model strengthens community-led systems from within.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>From learning to leadership<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>India is home to approximately <a href=\"https:\/\/india.mongabay.com\/2024\/02\/crafting-a-sustainable-future-for-artisans-using-bamboo\/?\">1.49 lakh bamboo artisans<\/a>, predominantly in rural and tribal areas&nbsp;.&nbsp;However, many lack exposure to urban markets and contemporary design trends.&nbsp;BRC addresses this gap by integrating traditional skills with modern market demands, thereby enhancing the artisans&#8217; competitiveness.<a href=\"https:\/\/india.mongabay.com\/2024\/02\/crafting-a-sustainable-future-for-artisans-using-bamboo\/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the most profound outcome of this initiative is not organisational growth, but the emergence of a networked ecosystem. As Manjusha notes, \u201cThey have now established good communication amongst themselves. It is kind of a small network of the small NGOs where they regularly come together, and they are growing that way.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is development done differently. It\u2019s not an injection of aid or a temporary intervention; it\u2019s the weaving of capacity, connection, and confidence into the fabric of community institutions. In doing so, the training has unlocked something more enduring than funding\u2014a sustainable cycle of mutual learning and local leadership.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why this matters<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The implications of this model go far beyond one village or one NGO. India is home to more than three million registered NGOs, many of which operate with limited visibility and funding. While their local knowledge and community roots are invaluable, their impact often remains restricted without the infrastructure to grow sustainably.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Empowering Grassroots&nbsp;offers a replicable blueprint: empower local organisations not by doing the work for them, but by enabling them to build the muscle for long-term action. Train them in skills like strategic communication, donor engagement, and needs-based planning. Provide mentorship that continues beyond the last workshop. Most importantly, foster a culture of collaboration\u2014where NGOs learn from each other and rise together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A bamboo blueprint for development<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The transformation of the Bamboo Resource Centre is not just about craft, funding, or strategy. It is about reclaiming agency. In turning inward to find strength, and outward to build partnerships, the BRC is crafting  a new development narrative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As India continues to address complex rural challenges\u2014from employment to sustainability to education\u2014the lesson from Raigad is clear. Solutions do not always come from above. Sometimes, they come from within\u2014from the grassroots, with the right support, at the right time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sources: <\/strong>Grand View Research and Mongabay<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the remote village communities of Raigad, Maharashtra, a centuries-old craft is making a modern comeback.
