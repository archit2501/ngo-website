However, getting an education alone does little unless we can ensure that our children and youth are continuing their education and not dropping out, ensuring that besides getting a quality education, they finish their schooling successfully.<br><br>Education should empower individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate life\u2019s challenges, contribute to their communities, and pursue their aspirations, thus transcending the notion of enrolment as the sole endgame.<br><br>The latest data from the Union Education Ministry\u2019s Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) Plus revealed that between 2022-23 and 2023-24, school enrolment in India fell by over a core.<br><br>As per the data, the gross enrolment ratio (GER) for various educational stages dropped across multiple levels. In the preparatory stage (Class III to V), the GER decreased from 41.9 percent in 2022-23 to 41.5 per cent in 2023-24. Similarly, the middle stage (Class VI to VIII) saw a slight reduction from 96.9 per cent to 96.5 percent. The most significant drop occurred at the secondary level (Class IX to XII), where the GER fell from 90 per cent to 89.5 percent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What does data say?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To mitigate these challenges, the NEP 2020 talks about reaching a 100 percent gross enrolment ratio (GER) of students in schools from preschool to secondary level by 2030. It aims to achieve this by two initiatives. The first is to develop sufficient infrastructure for students to access safe and engaging school education at all levels up to class 12. The second is to create a tracking system to record students&#8217; progress at various stages and provide them with guidance counselors and well-trained social workers. In the view of NEP 2020, this is key for retaining students in the school education system.<br><br>To address these difficulties, the NEP 2020 outlines a 100% gross enrolment ratio (GER) of pupils in schools from preschool to secondary level by 2030. It intends to achieve this through two efforts. The first step is to create adequate infrastructure for students to receive safe and enjoyable school instruction at all levels up to grade 12. The second step is to establish a tracking system to monitor kids&#8217; progress at various stages and to give them guidance counselors and well-trained social workers. According to NEP 2020, this is critical for keeping pupils in the school education system.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Improving infrastructure&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The UIDSE+ 2023-24 School Infrastructure research in India finds that significant progress has been made in ensuring basic facilities such as gender-specific bathrooms and functional drinking water. However, the research highlights severe issues in advanced infrastructure. Poor internet access and inadequate technology readiness indicate a substantial digital divide. Furthermore, the lack of inclusive infrastructure, such as stairs, railings, and operable desks, emphasises the accessibility divide.<br><br>Investing in better school facilities ultimately means investing in our children\u2019s future and the overall welfare of our communities. Improving school infrastructure goes beyond physical structures; it creates an environment that fosters inclusive learning and benefits students, educators, and the broader community. Modern facilities, such as well-equipped libraries, labs, and technology rooms, enhance student learning by providing essential resources, while well-ventilated and comfortable classrooms promote focus. Safe and secure buildings with proper sanitation and recreational spaces contribute to student well-being, reducing stress and encouraging engagement. For educators, well-maintained classrooms and collaborative spaces support creative teaching methods and build a sense of community. A stimulating and resource-rich environment can boost attendance by making students more eager to learn. Furthermore, upgraded school infrastructure enhances the community\u2019s image, attracts families, and provides event spaces, strengthening school-community ties.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Attendance tracking system&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Efficient attendance tracking can be a foundational pillar supporting the entire educational process. As technology rapidly digitises, the reach of a School Management System (SMS) is set to expand. The ancient approach of manually taking attendance, which was prone to inaccuracies and time-consuming, has given way to an era of precision and real-time data via this technology.<br><br>A student&#8217;s regular presence in the classroom is inextricably related to academic success and overall growth. Efficient attendance tracking is not merely a bureaucratic formality but can be a fundamental pillar underpinning the entire educational process. At a time when the world is fast moving towards digitisation, the scope of school management systems is poised for expansion. The archaic method of manual attendance-taking, prone to errors and time-consuming, has given way to an era of precision and real-time data through School Management System (SMS) technology.&nbsp; An SMS can be used for various purposes, including academic record-keeping and communication. However, its most crucial job is in the area of attendance tracking. As a result, these systems provide a holistic solution for enhancing overall school efficiency through increased student attendance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Other measures to boost enrolment&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Building trust and engagement<\/strong><br><br>To increase enrolment for students in rural and remote areas, educators must build trust and relationships with local stakeholders, including students, parents, teachers, counsellors, community leaders, and organisations. Establishing credibility through respect, active listening, campaigns, and involvement in decision-making fosters a sense of belonging and partnership, making rural communities more open to educational opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Information and guidance<\/strong><br><br>To boost enrolment for students in rural areas, educators must provide clear information and guidance on higher education&#8217;s benefits, costs, and requirements, addressing misconceptions and accessibility challenges. Multiple channels, such as local meetings, brochures, campaigns, and in-person visits, can help inform and inspire rural students and their families while addressing their concerns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Providing support<\/strong><br><br>Educators must provide support and resources\u2014such as tutoring, mentoring, financial aid assistance, and transportation\u2014to help students navigate the application and transition process. Educators can empower rural students and their families by addressing challenges like academic preparation, financial barriers, and logistical hurdles, ensuring successful enrolment and retention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Smile Foundation: Mission Education<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuring students keep up with schooling requires genuine care, monitoring, and improvement of the system.
