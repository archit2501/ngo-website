Rudolph\u2019s glowing red nose, once seen as a flaw that made him an outcast, ultimately became his greatest strength, enabling him to lead Santa\u2019s sleigh through a storm. This tiny tale captures a vital truth about human beings: each person is unique, carrying individual traits that may set them apart but also hold great potential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drawing from this context, it is natural to consider the transitive thought: Is every child too unique? Undoubtedly, just like Rudolph, each child has their own strengths, talents, and passions\u2014qualities that may set them apart and deserve to be recognised and nurtured. But, given the global system we live in, we often treat children as if they are meant to be the same, holding them to identical expectations and standards, rather than honouring their individual differences. Moreover, the uniqueness of every child extends beyond academic or vocational skills. It encompasses emotional, social, and cultural dimensions, all of which contribute to a child\u2019s identity and capacity for growth, making it pertinent that we address this uniqueness and henceforth create a safe environment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-stepping-away-from-norm\"><strong>Stepping away from norm<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\"   title=\"Education\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2493\">education<\/a> in India was deeply rooted in contextual, value-based learning, transmitted through systems such as <em>gurukuls<\/em> where spiritual, practical, and intellectual development were integrated. However, the present-day Indian education system has diverged sharply from these holistic foundations. Over the last few decades, it is largely characterised by rote memorisation, exam-centric evaluation as well as limited engagement with real-world applicability. Unsurprisingly, this disconnect has contributed to an unemployment rate for those with postgraduate degrees and above was 13.6 per cent as per 2023-24 Periodic Labour Force <a href=\"https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/city\/bhubaneswar\/unemployment-rate-higher-among-graduates-above-in-state-plfs-report\/articleshow\/116573342.cms\">Survey<\/a> (PLFS) report by NSSO.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In light of this, a critical examination of current educational practices is essential. From early schooling onwards, students are compelled to conform to rigid academic frameworks and standardised assessments that define success narrowly\u2014often in terms of marks, ranks, and entrance exams. This institutional emphasis on uniformity leaves little room for individual growth, creativity, or emotional development. As a result, students who do not align with the system\u2019s narrow criteria are frequently marginalised, despite possessing talents that fall outside conventional academic measures. This reductive, \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d model not only suppresses innovation but also undermines the diverse potential of learners across the country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a country as diverse as India, recognising that every child is unique is not just a philosophical stance\u2014it is a practical necessity. Educational frameworks and social policies must therefore adopt holistic models that accommodate diverse backgrounds and learning styles. In fact, the education systems and aligning policies need to move beyond mere acknowledgment of diversity to actively accommodate it. This means creating equitable environments where children can discover themselves, pursue their strengths, and grow holistically. Smile Foundation\u2019s \u2018Every Child in School\u2019 campaign is a key example that translates this vision in action. Through its Mission Education programme, the initiative identifies out-of-school children from marginalised communities\u2014whether in remote villages, tribal regions, or urban slums\u2014and provides them access to quality education tailored to their context. Importantly, Smile\u2019s work extends beyond academics to address <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/health\/\"   title=\"Health\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2494\">health<\/a>, nutrition, and co-curricular development, thereby nurturing each child&#8217;s full potential.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such a model reaffirms the core idea: when we embrace the uniqueness of every child, we lay the foundation for a more just and inclusive educational future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-towards-an-equivalent-system-nbsp\"><strong>Towards an equivalent system&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to changes at the classroom and school levels, systemic transformation must also occur at the policy level. Educational reforms need to prioritise flexibility in curriculum design, invest in continuous teacher development, and promote the recognition of multiple forms of intelligence\u2014not just academic achievement. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 marks a significant step in this direction by advocating for learner-centric and inclusive approaches by encouraging flexible curricula that cater to diverse learning styles. This approach resonates strongly with the work of Smile Foundation in the vocational training space. Through initiatives like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ipeglobal.com\/project-manzil-inspires-young-girls-to-seek-aspiring-careers\/\">Project Manzil<\/a>, we have supported youth by providing them with market-oriented skill training, life skills education, and job placement support, allowing them to make more informed decisions about their lives in the due course.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In line with these policy directions, another one of Smile Foundation&#8217;s programmes called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/child-for-child\/\">Child for Child (CFC)<\/a> exemplifies grassroots efforts to nurture empathy and social responsibility among young learners. This initiative\u2014started in 2006\u2014focuses on sensitising privileged children and their families to the deep social and educational inequalities that exist around them and in the process, nurture empathy, social responsibility, and a strong value system in young minds, so they grow into conscientious citizens and agents of change. Through visits to schools and interactive sessions, \u2018CFC\u2019 encourages privileged children to reflect on their own circumstances, recognise the challenges faced by their less fortunate peers, and understand the importance of equity and inclusion. In doing so, the programme not only fosters compassion but also reinforces the idea that every child\u2019s experience is unique\u2014and that acknowledging and respecting these differences is the first step towards building a just and supportive educational ecosystem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question of whether every child is truly unique calls for more than just recognition\u2014it requires purposeful action. We must not only acknowledge the distinct strengths and talents each child possesses but also commit to creating systems and environments that nurture these differences. By doing so, we enable children to develop their individual potential fully and pave the way for a more just society where every child has the opportunity to thrive on their own terms.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>India\u2019s education system still leans heavily on uniformity, often at the cost of creativity, individuality, and equity.
