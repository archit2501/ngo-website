It aims to create a safe space where individuals can express their thoughts, emotions, and aspirations freely, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the impact of Smile Foundation\u2019s social development programmes on their lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the story of lively and enthusiastic Nazneen* (13 years) enrolled in our Mission <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\"   title=\"Education\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"1974\">Education<\/a> (ME) programme center located at Shri Ram J.J.Colony, Dhaula Kuan, New Delhi in her own words.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Nazneen, you\u2019re in class 9th and senior to most kids here. Do you help them with their homework and studies? What is your favourite subject?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Oh, I love being able to help other kids at the center. It&#8217;s like being a big sister to them! They always come up to me when they want any help with their Maths or History questions. I enjoy my studies, I actually like to study a lot. When I first joined the centre last year, I was not very good at Maths but we had a teacher who explained the concepts to me and motivated me and since then I developed interest in Maths and now when I help these other kids with the same subject, I feel very good. It makes me very happy when my teachers appreciate me and I get good marks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>That\u2019s nice. What else do you enjoy? What are your hobbies?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">I spend most of my time reading Hindi story books or solving problems&nbsp; but I also absolutely love singing and dancing! Although I&#8217;m a bit shy in front of others, I copy dance steps from YouTube videos and try to pretend like I am a dancer. I listen to a lot of Korean songs and I also like to copy their dance steps. I have also picked up a few Korean phrases (giggles). It is a lot of fun, me and my friends enjoy these songs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>That\u2019s very interesting, how are your parents like? What do they do?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Oh, my parents are amazing! My dad works at Delhi University in the horticulture department, and he&#8217;s really passionate about plants and gardens. It&#8217;s always fun to hear him talk about his work. My mom is a homemaker, she never got the opportunity to study in school so I teach her how to read Hindi. It&#8217;s a special bonding time for us, and it makes me happy to see her progress. And you know what? I even taught her how to do a signature! It&#8217;s a small thing, but it&#8217;s our little achievement together. Just yesterday she asked me \u201c <em>mujhe English me bhi sign karna sikhado<\/em>\u201d, I love that can do these little things for her.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>What are your goals and aspirations for the future in terms of your education and your passion?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Oh, I have so many goals and aspirations for my future! First and foremost, I aspire to become an IAS officer. I want to make a positive impact on society and contribute to the betterment of my country. I have another dream and passion that I would love to share. Besides becoming an IAS officer, I also have a deep desire to become a teacher. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">I&#8217;m so inspired by this education centre and the impact it has on students&#8217; lives. I dream of opening my own centre one day, where I can teach and help others in their educational journey. I want to have an inclusive space where anyone, regardless of their background, can come and join our classes. I particularly want to support mothers who couldn&#8217;t study when they were young, and I want to empower them through education. It&#8217;s a dream that fills my heart with joy and purpose, and I hope to make it a reality in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Is there anything else that you want to share? Any other dreams or passions?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Yes, I also have a deep desire to travel the world and explore different cultures. Korea is a place I really want to visit because I&#8217;m fascinated by their culture. In fact, I dream of traveling abroad and showcasing my singing and dancing talents. It would be incredible to perform on an international stage and become famous. I want to be a K-pop star so that people from all around the world will know me. So many dreams to fulfil,I don&#8217;t think one life is enough to live all of them, but let me try living at least one of them with all my heart and hardwork.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>*Name changed due to confidentiality concerns<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Recognising the importance of capturing authentic voices and narratives, here is another interview from Soul and Substance series to share stories of change.
