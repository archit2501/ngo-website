Indigestion is the root of many diseases we face later on in our lives. With that in mind, how well we digest the food ultimately depends on what and how we eat.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p><em>\u2018Jaisa ann waisa mann\u2019<\/em>, meaning what you eat decides your mental wellbeing as well, is an old Indian saying, said repeatedly by our forefathers. Food researchers have found that healthy food, food rich in vitamins, protein, minerals and antioxidants, make our brain stress free and happy. While food filled with refined sugar harms our mood and <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/health\/\"   title=\"Health\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"1200\">health<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Average Indian Diet<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Indian cuisine finds remarkable depth in its simple, everyday ingredients. Staples like rice, wheat, millets, and pulses form the foundation, complemented by the goodness of dairy, vegetables, and fruits. This balance of flavors is beautifully showcased in regional variations, with the North&#8217;s affinity for wheat and the South&#8217;s love for rice.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, the average Indian diet presents a paradox. Our diets can often lack sufficient protein and other essential nutrients, leading to malnutrition in significant portions of the population. This <a href=\"https:\/\/indianexpress.com\/article\/cities\/chandigarh\/north-indian-diet-high-salt-phosphorus-low-potassium-protein-study-red-flag-9237342\/\">dietary imbalance is highlighted in a recent study<\/a> from PGIMER, Chandigarh, and The George Institute for Global Health, India.<\/p>\n\n<p>Findings show that many North Indians consume too much salt and phosphorus while not getting enough protein and potassium. In mostly vegetarian households, protein intake averages a concerning 39-57 grams daily, significantly less than the recommended intake based on body weight.<\/p>\n\n<p>This underscores the importance of awareness about<\/p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Nutritional Needs and the Challenges of Healthy Diet Access in India<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>India currently has around 194.4 million undernourished or malnourished individuals. Child malnutrition rates are alarmingly high, and anemia affects the majority of children under five. States like Maharashtra, Bihar, and Gujarat showing the worst levels of child malnutrition. Poverty, socioeconomic status, and location all contribute significantly to the malnutrition crisis of India.<\/p>\n\n<p>Addressing malnutrition requires a multifaceted approach, including:<\/p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Food security:<\/strong> Ensuring that all individuals have access to affordable, nutritious food.<\/li>\n\n<li><strong>Dietary <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\"   title=\"Education\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2162\">education<\/a>:<\/strong> Promoting knowledge about balanced meals and the consequences of nutrient deficiencies.<\/li>\n\n<li><strong>Targeted interventions:<\/strong> Providing support for vulnerable groups like children, pregnant women, and the elderly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Healthy Diet<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>Eating healthy food is like investing in your body&#8217;s long-term well-being.\u00a0 A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein provides the essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber that your body craves.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>These nutrients fuel your energy levels, boost your immune system, and protect against chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and some forms of cancer. Think of it this way,\u00a0 healthy eating lays the foundation for a strong and resilient body that can carry you through life with vitality.<\/p>\n\n<p>WHO defines a healthy diet in four parts &#8211;\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Staples like cereals (wheat, barley, rye, maize or rice) or starchy tubers or roots (potato, yam, taro or cassava).<\/li>\n\n<li>Legumes (lentils and beans).<\/li>\n\n<li>Fruit and vegetables.<\/li>\n\n<li>Foods from animal sources (meat, fish, eggs and milk).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Unhealthy Diet!\u00a0<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n<p>To maximize the benefits of healthy eating, it is important to be mindful of foods that can sabotage your well-being.\u00a0 Top culprits include heavily processed foods, which are often packed with unhealthy fats, added sugars, sodium, and artificial ingredients. These foods can contribute to weight gain, inflammation, and increased risk of chronic disease. It is best to limit your intake of items like sugary drinks, refined carbohydrates (white bread, pastries), processed meats, fried foods, and overly salty snacks.<\/p>\n\n<p>While indulging in your favorite treats occasionally is okay, be aware of &#8220;hidden&#8221; sources of unhealthy ingredients.\u00a0Many pre-packaged foods, sauces, and dressings can contain high amounts of added sugar, sodium, and unhealthy fats. Reading food labels carefully and opting for fresh, whole foods whenever possible is a great way to take control of your diet and limit your intake of harmful ingredients that can undermine your health goals.<\/p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Importance of Eating Healthy Food<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Beyond physical health, a balanced diet has remarkable power over your mood and mental well-being.\u00a0Studies show that nourishing foods can reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, improve focus and concentration,\u00a0 and promote a more positive outlook on life.\u00a0When you nourish your brain with the right fuel, you give it the resources to function at its best.\u00a0Healthy eating is not just about looking good &#8211; it is about feeling good, both inside and out. The benefits are numerous &#8211;<\/p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Weight management:<\/strong> Healthy eating helps you maintain a healthy weight or lose weight if needed.<\/li>\n\n<li><strong>Boosted energy levels:<\/strong> Whole foods provide sustained energy, avoiding the crashes from sugary snacks.<\/li>\n\n<li><strong>Disease prevention:<\/strong> Reduces your risk of chronic conditions like heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer.<\/li>\n\n<li><strong>Improved mental health:<\/strong> A balanced diet promotes positive mood and better cognitive function.<\/li>\n\n<li><strong>Stronger bones and muscles:<\/strong> Eating right supports a healthy body throughout your life.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to Tell if You Eat Healthy?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Investing in healthy food can seem daunting, but the benefits far outweigh the initial effort. While it takes some adjustment, choosing whole foods over processed ones will benefit your energy levels, digestion, and overall well-being. Start with small changes, like adding an extra serving of vegetables to your meals or replacing sugary drinks with water. Your body will thank you for prioritizing its health, and those small choices will pave the way for a more vibrant and energized you.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here are some signs you are on the right track &#8211;<\/p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Natural energy:<\/strong> You feel energized throughout the day without major slumps.<\/li>\n\n<li><strong>Stable moods:<\/strong> Your mood is generally positive with fewer episodes of irritability.<\/li>\n\n<li><strong>Digestive health:<\/strong> You have regular bowel movements and minimal bloating.<\/li>\n\n<li><strong>Clarity of mind:<\/strong> You experience focus and mental sharpness.<\/li>\n\n<li><strong>Overall well-being:<\/strong> You simply feel good in your own skin.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>In the end, it is right to say that our relationship with food is deeply personal, yet it also shapes the health of our communities.\u00a0Understanding the link between diet and well-being empowers us to make informed choices.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>We should collectively strive to make healthy diet options accessible for all in India, support education about the benefits of whole foods, and tackle malnutrition with determination. Remember,\u00a0each time we prioritize nourishing meals,\u00a0we invest in a better future for ourselves and for generations to come.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the soace of women empowerment, Smile Foundation&#8217;s <em><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/women-empowerment\/\">Swabhiman <\/a><\/strong><\/em>programme extends its focus beyond traditional boundaries by emphasizing the critical role of healthy diets in fostering holistic development.
