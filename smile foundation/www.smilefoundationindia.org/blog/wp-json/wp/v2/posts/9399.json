Sunita, a software engineer and a mother of two, was making breakfast for her kids while skimming through her work emails. Her kids were playing in the living room, busy with their toys. She made them sit at the small table and instructed them to eat the food in silence, while she went back to her laptop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As she responded to the emails, she looked at her kids and thought about how her experience of motherhood was different from her mother\u2019s. The good thing was that her mother could give a lot of time and attention to her kids. But the flip side was that she never had the opportunity to work outside the home and explore her potential as a career woman.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the world changes, the way we live our lives and the traditional roles we play are also shifting. One of the biggest changes is happening in how motherhood is perceived and experienced. In this article, we will look at these many facets of motherhood and how they are evolving.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a><\/a><strong>Traditional perceptions of motherhood<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you watched an old Bollywood movie, you would see the mother as this doting woman who dedicates all her time to raising her children, managing the household, and supporting her husband as he goes out to work and make money. It is this aspect of motherhood \u2013 the giver and caregiver \u2013 that has been time and again equated with divinity. \u2018Mother is God\u2019 is a saying that most Indians are aware of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been the role of the mother historically \u2013 the one who is self-sacrificing, nurturing and devoted entirely to her family. If we look at the global perceptions of motherhood, we can find similarities, at least from the point of view of the domestic roles that women were restricted to. The archetype of a mother was often one who stayed at home, caring for her children and household, embodying patience, love and sacrifice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, with the complex changes happening in the world, the contemporary landscape of motherhood has evolved. The perception of motherhood is not limited to domestic affairs anymore. Instead, it now extends to various aspects of society, professional lives and politics. This is also indicative of the broader societal shift towards demand for greater gender equality and sharing of responsibilities between both men and women.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a><\/a><strong>Evolving definitions and roles<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Motherhood today is not limited to a particular gender and a specific kind of domestic role. It is now absorbing a wide spectrum of experiences. Adoptive mothers, single fathers and LGBTQA+ parents can all fall under the umbrella of motherhood today. According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/social-trends\/2014\/04\/08\/record-share-of-americans-have-never-married\/\">Pew Research Centre<\/a>, there has been a significant rise in the number of single-parent households and blended families which is now challenging the traditional norms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, there has been a shift in how the role of women is viewed in society. It is now moving beyond the traditional nurturing figure and is entering the areas where women are also seen as breadwinners, influencers, and decision-makers in the family. This change can primarily be attributed to the economic factors and the increased participation of women in the workforce. Additionally, social media and exposure to progressive ideas has provided a platform to the women where they can share and learn from each other\u2019s experiences. This way, they can also seek support and guidance from women who are letting go of traditional motherhood archetype and embracing the new ways of life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It should also be noted here that a comparatively higher number of women are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/wellness\/2024\/sep\/26\/regret-having-children-no-kids-cultural-taboo\">also choosing to not become mothers<\/a> and instead, focus on their professional lives. While this idea is opposed by the traditionalists, it shows how women are now willing to break the existing stereotypes and experiment with lifestyles that make me look out-of-ordinary to many.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a><\/a><strong>The impact of technology<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Age is something that has always been seen as a crucial factor in motherhood. It was believed that women get married early and birth children at a young age when their bodies are capable of it. This had a significant impact on how girls were educated, their marriage and the roles that they were allocated very early in life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, these perceptions are now shifting because of the rapid <a href=\"https:\/\/www.asrm.org\/\">advancements in technology<\/a> where solutions like IVF and surrogacy provide opportunities to women that they can embrace motherhood even at a later stage in life. This means more and more women can choose to focus on their <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\"   title=\"Education\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2309\">education<\/a> and careers, and only become mothers later in life when they feel prepared for it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we are also living in the information age, parenting apps and other platforms are also playing a crucial role in helping women make these decisions. Choosing not to give birth, adopt a child or having a child much later in life can all be seen as decisions against the traditional stereotypes and may be an isolating experience for many women. However, with so much support and guidance available online, women can make better decisions for themselves and feel supported.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a><\/a><strong>Embracing new ways of motherhood<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Working mothers \u2013 <\/strong>As mentioned above, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/\">more and more women<\/a> are now choosing to be working mothers instead of giving up their careers and professional aspirations to take care of their children. However, the challenges faced by working mothers are many and there is still a long way to go in terms of family support, childcare facilities, parental leaves, etc.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cultural variations \u2013 <\/strong>While traditional Indian values continue to hold, contemporary Indian mothers balance these expectations with modern aspirations. In many cultures, the extended family plays a significant role in child-rearing. In India, the involvement of grandparents, aunts, and uncles in raising children is common, providing a support network for mothers. This support is now even more crucial as women are now choosing to balance their careers with motherhood.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mental health and motherhood &#8211; <\/strong>According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/news-room\/fact-sheets\/detail\/mental-health-and-psychosocial-wellbeing\">World Health Organization<\/a>, about 10% of pregnant women and 13% of postpartum women worldwide experience mental disorders, primarily depression. There is a growing need for mental <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/health\/\"   title=\"Health\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"1326\">health<\/a> support and resources for mothers. Traditionally, these issues were brushed under the carpet because of the taboo surrounding mental health. However, modern mothers are not avoiding the mental health issues related to motherhood and are talking about it openly. This is opening up new ways of looking at motherhood and deciding whether one wants to opt for it or not.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Environmental consciousness \u2013<\/strong> While it may not be a significant factor at the moment, there are women who are now adopting more eco-conscious parenting practices, which means they might be using more sustainable ways for raising their children. At the same time, some women may choose to adopt instead of having their own children, while others may decide not to have children at all. Economic realities of our world and climate change are also playing a big part in this decision-making.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>LGBTQIA+ motherhood \u2013 <\/strong>Gender queer couples may not have had the option of adopting a child in the past or going for other options of experiencing motherhood. However, with changes in society, more supportive legal frameworks, and higher acceptance; these barriers are breaking. In future, we may have more LGBTQIA+ couples raising children and embracing new ways of motherhood.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a><\/a><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The journey of motherhood today is multifaceted and diverse, shaped by evolving societal norms, technological advancements and increased awareness of mental health and environmental issues. While the traditional reverence for motherhood remains, modern mothers are redefining their roles, balancing careers, personal aspirations and family life. The future of motherhood will continue to evolve, reflecting the resilience, adaptability and enduring love of mothers around the world.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It was a regular busy morning in Hyderabad.
