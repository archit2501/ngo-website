The prevalence of crime against the most vulnerable members of society, particularly children, highlights the distressing state of both their well-being and that of society as a whole. Today, minors worldwide are exposed to a variety of hazards, including forced labour, trafficking, abduction and sexual abuse and exploitation.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us examine the seven most common crimes against children in India.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Child Labour<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the outset of 2020, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unicef.org\/innocenti\/media\/9356\/file\/UNICEF-Innocenti-Child-labour-schooling-India-Report-2024.pdf\">the global estimates of child labour<\/a> indicated&nbsp;that 160 million children, including 63 million girls and 97 million boys, were engaged in child labour worldwide. Child labour is defined as work that is detrimental to the <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/health\/\"   title=\"Health\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"1349\">health<\/a> and development of children and obstructs their right to education.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Work includes anything that poses mental, physical, social or moral risks to children. Additionally, work that obstructs their <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\"   title=\"Education\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2337\">education<\/a> by denying them the opportunity to attend school, necessitating early departure; or compelling them to juggle school attendance with excessively burdensome and prolonged work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poverty is a key factor contributing to child labour, but other elements also come into play. These include family expectations, limited access to education and childcare and societal views that minimise the risks associated with early work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Child Trafficking<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.iom.int\/world-day-against-trafficking-persons-2024\">Despite global efforts, one in three victims of trafficking in persons is a child.<\/a> Child trafficking is the exploitation of children, which is a grievous abuse of human rights. Children are deceived and forced, or convinced to leave their homes to be trafficked and exploited. Severe exploitation can be encountered by children in a variety of ways. Sexual exploitation is the act of producing child sexual abuse material or abusing a child for commercial gain. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Children are subjected to harsh conditions in sectors such as agriculture, factories, mining or domestic labour as a result of forced labour. Many are compelled to engage in petty offences, such as theft or to beg. Children may be enslaved, sexually exploited or recruited as combatants during armed conflicts. Another severe issue is child marriage, in which females are married off for financial gain or social status. Furthermore, the trafficking of infants and children for illicit adoption frequently involves the deception or coercion of their guardians.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Child Begging<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Child begging is a critical issue that frequently arises at congested intersections, where young children beg money from cars that pass. Sometimes, children are forced to contribute to their poor\u00a0household&#8217;s finances by earning money through begging or they are abducted from their hometowns to beg on roads. Illegal immigration is frequently the result of India&#8217;s numerous borders with countries such as Nepal and Bangladesh. The children of numerous migrants are compelled to beg on the streets for additional financial assistance as a result of destitution and unemployment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Child Sexual Abuse<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.indiatoday.in\/education-today\/featurephilia\/story\/child-sexual-abuse-in-india-alarming-statistics-lifelong-impact-how-to-heal-2416285-2023-08-04\">The NCRB data from 2020<\/a> reveals that only 65.6% of child abuse incidents were reported, even though around 28.9% of minors faced some type of sexual violence.Child sexual abuse is the act of an adult, adolescent, or older child engaging in sexual activity with a child. A child sexual abuser may be a family member, a close relative, neighbours, religious leaders, teachers or instructors. They originate from all socio-economic strata of society, regardless of their sexual orientation, racial or religious affiliation. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both men and women\u00a0are capable of perpetrating child sex offences. Survivors of child sexual abuse can experience significant and enduring impacts on their physical, emotional, psychological and social well-being throughout their adult lives. Of course, a traditional conservative family and community structure that does not discuss sex and sexuality is a contributing factor. Consequently, all forms of sexual abuse that a child experiences are not reported to anyone.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Child Marriage<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/data.unicef.org\/resources\/ending-child-marriage-a-profile-of-progress-in-india-2023\/\">One in three of the world\u2019s child brides live in India<\/a>. Child marriage is a violation of children&#8217;s rights and exposes them to a high risk of exploitation, harm and violence. Both boys and girls are impacted by child marriage; however, girls are more severely affected. A girl\u00a0who is married as a child is likely to leave school, not earn a living and not contribute to the community. She is at a higher risk of contracting HIV\/AIDS and experiencing domestic violence. She is more susceptible to having children during her childhood. The likelihood of her death as a result of complications during pregnancy and childbirth is higher.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Child marriage is caused by economic, social and cultural causes. Due to poverty, families may marry daughters for dowries or to relieve financial obligations. Lack of economic prospects makes it harder for families to support their children. Patriarchal and traditional values support early marriage, and conflict makes females more prone to it as a kind of protection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Governments and authorities <a href=\"https:\/\/satyarthi.org.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/BondedLabor\/English\/Summary%20of%20the%20Child%20Protection%20Laws%20in%20India.pdf\">need to step up and strengthen laws to protect children<\/a> by increasing penalties for offenders, ensuring consistent monitoring and enforcement of existent laws, and providing victim support services. They should also promote awareness campaigns, improve access to education and work with communities to challenge harmful cultural practices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smile Foundation is deeply committed to addressing the challenges faced by the girl child in India, striving to create a safer, more equitable future through its comprehensive initiatives. Through the <em><a href=\"https:\/\/donate.smilefoundationindia.org\/donate-for-girl-child\">She Can Fly<\/a><\/em> programme, we empower girls with access to education, healthcare and life skills, helping them break free from exploitation and discrimination. By fostering environments where girls can thrive, Smile Foundation combats critical issues such as child labour, trafficking and early marriage, ensuring that girls are not only protected but also given the tools to reach their full potential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Education lies at the heart of Smile Foundation&#8217;s mission to support the <a href=\"https:\/\/donate.smilefoundationindia.org\/donate-for-girl-child\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">girl child<\/a>. Recognising that education is a powerful tool against exploitation, we provide quality education to underprivileged girls, emphasising the importance of keeping them in school and out of harmful practices like child marriage and labour. Alongside education, Smile Foundation also promotes health awareness, focusing on <a href=\"https:\/\/donate.smilefoundationindia.org\/women-empowerment\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">nutrition and menstrual hygiene<\/a>, to ensure girls grow up healthy and informed. These efforts align with their goal of transforming not just individual lives but entire communities by empowering girls to become agents of change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Community engagement is central to Smile Foundation\u2019s work with girl children. Through awareness programmes, we address patriarchal mindsets and harmful practices, advocating for the rights of girls and emphasising their critical role in building a stronger society. By working closely with families, schools and local leaders, we try to create a supportive network to protect girls from abuse and exploitation while providing them with opportunities to succeed. This holistic approach not only addresses immediate threats but also creates pathways where every girl is valued, respected and empowered to lead a life of dignity.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The former South African President Nelson Mandela once said,\u00a0\u2018There can be no keener revelation of a society\u2019s soul than the way in which it treats its children\u201d.
