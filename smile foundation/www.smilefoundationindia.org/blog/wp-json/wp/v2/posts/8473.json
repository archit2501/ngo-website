A recent <a href=\"https:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamanetworkopen\/fullarticle\/2814926\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Harvard study<\/a>, published earlier this year, terms this phenomenon as \u2018zero-food\u2019 children where they do not consume milk, any formula or food for an entire day.<br><br>According to the study, India has an estimated 6.7 million \u2018zero-food\u2019 children which accounts for half the population of \u2018zero-food\u2019 children across 91 other countries included in the survey. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of October 2021, it was estimated that over 33 lakh children in India remained malnourished\u00a0and more than half of them fall in the severely malnourished category. Further, with the Covid pandemic exacerbating the health and nutrition crisis among the underserved strata of society, the Women and Child Development Ministry estimated that there are 17.76 lakh severely acute malnourished children and 15.46 lakh other children being moderately acute <a href=\"https:\/\/indianexpress.com\/article\/india\/33-lakh-children-india-malnourished-17-lakh-severely-malnourished-govt-data-7611676\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">malnourished<\/a>.<a href=\"https:\/\/indianexpress.com\/article\/india\/33-lakh-children-india-malnourished-17-lakh-severely-malnourished-govt-data-7611676\/\"><br><br><\/a>UNICEF in 2022 said that India has the highest number of children suffering from acute malnutrition. In its May 2022 child alert, the global body had called the situation an \u2018overlooked child survival emergency\u2019 with the situation in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.downtoearth.org.in\/news\/health\/india-has-world-s-highest-number-of-children-with-severe-acute-malnutrition-unicef-82906\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">South Asian country being worse<\/a> than that of sub-Saharan Africa. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How are CSR partnerships\/donations and healthy children related?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>India\u2019s overall <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/health\/\"   title=\"Health\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"1239\">health<\/a> expenditure has always been towards a moderately lower limit drawing heavy criticism from health experts and activists. A recent Lancet report says that the country\u2019s healthcare expenditure lies at 1.2% of the GDP as against a planned vision of 2.5% by 2025. <a href=\"https:\/\/thewire.in\/health\/govt-spending-on-healthcare-low-data-transparency-crucial-the-lancet\"><br><br><\/a>While the overall appropriations for the Union budget 2021\u201322 increased by 14.5%, however, the portion devoted to child nutrition decreased by 18.5% from 2020\u201321 to 2021\u20132022.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Budgetary allocation cuts like these severely compound an already flailing health crisis, distinctly affecting the children, there has to be a need to move beyond government funding and encourage third-party resources to ensure that every child has access to the right nutrition. While several not-for-profit organisations, large-scale enterprises, social firms, health donors, and so on, have actively pulled in funds to mitigate hunger ills, the country must do more and donate through <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/corporate-partnership\/\"   title=\"Corporate Partnerships\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"378\">CSR<\/a> partnerships for child health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The interventions of healthcare funding<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The funding will further help adopt tools beyond the prevalent methods of monitoring children&#8217;s health. Here\u2019s how: In India, the most important government tool to track a child\u2019s health and nutrition is the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), which provides a supplement nutrition programme to facilitate <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\"   title=\"Education\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2211\">education<\/a>. However, services like ICDS and midday school meals have become irregular following the prolonged closure of schools due to the pandemic and poor maintenance of primary schools, disproportionately affecting children living in multi-dimensional poverty as these vulnerable youth have been largely dependent on these services to fulfil their rights and entitlements<br><br>Further, more budgetary allocations must be strategised to afford services like RUTF (Ready to Use Therapeutic Food) to help with malnutrition in children under 5 years. According to a UNICEF estimate, it costs about Rs 7,000 to complete one course of RUTF with an amount of 10-15 kgs over eight to six weeks without considering the transportation and delivery costs.\u00a0 However, with the pandemic-induced economic distress along with the Ukraine-Russia war, the cost may have increased by manifolds. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>India\u2019s children are their future<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With so many challenges lining the way up for the improved health of a child, it is imperative for socially-inclined businesses to partner with nonprofits for child health which will help in further collaborations with project partners at the grassroots levels and bring about a sustainable transformation in India\u2019s health narrative.<br><br>Children are the future of the country and to ensure their well-being, one needs to invest in their health. Healthy children ensure a healthy country and prosperity. Moreover, most adult health complexities trickle down to their childhood. So it is important to maintain a healthy childhood to avoid medical complications in later years.<br><br>Further, health funders must donate for child health for several other connecting factors; it also leads you to ensure the proper health of the country&#8217;s mothers and women as the health of a child is closely related to a mother\u2019s nutrition. Second, one needs to partner and donate for child health as they are the most vulnerable population of a country, dependent on others for resources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What we do<\/strong> <strong>for healthy children of India<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Smile Foundation<\/a>, we believe in equal healthcare for all.
