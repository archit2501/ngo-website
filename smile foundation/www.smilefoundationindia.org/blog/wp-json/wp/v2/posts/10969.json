Yet, her education came to an abrupt halt when she turned thirteen; not because of disinterest or inability, but due to the lack of safe and hygienic toilets in her school. Fearing for her safety, Priya\u2019s parents, like many others in the village, decided to pull her out. Her story, though personal, mirrors the silent crisis unfolding across India, where basic infrastructural deficiencies force millions of children to abandon education.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dropping out doesn\u2019t just end a child\u2019s formal education, it reinforces cycles of poverty and inequality. If India is to secure a better future for its young population, addressing the root causes of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/school-dropouts-interfering-with-desired-progress-in-india\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">school dropouts<\/a> must be a national priority.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The infrastructure gap leading to school dropouts<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Often, the barriers to education are painfully basic. According to the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+), only <strong>56% of schools in India have functional toilets for girls<\/strong>. For adolescent girls, this shortfall is not only inconvenient but dangerous, frequently leading to withdrawal from school. In rural India, nearly <strong>there is still a <a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s43832-024-00145-2#:~:text=In%20rural%20India%2C%20limited%20access,connections%20to%20every%20rural%20household.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lack of safe drinking water<\/a><\/strong>, exposing children to illness and discouraging regular attendance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poor infrastructure\u2014crumbling classrooms, lack of desks, unreliable electricity\u2014sends a message: education is not a priority. Students across grades are often taught together due to space constraints, with schools lacking even the most basic amenities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Where are the teachers?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The teacher-student ratio in many Indian schools is dismal. Several lack qualified educators for essential subjects, and existing teachers are burdened with administrative tasks, elections, and census duties. Add to this a lack of training and pedagogical support, and it\u2019s no surprise that students fail to stay engaged.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When children receive little individual attention or instruction suited to their learning level, the system slowly pushes them out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Poverty and patriarchy<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many families, especially in rural and urban poor communities, simply cannot afford to keep their children in school. Economic necessity compels them to involve children in work\u2014whether in farms, factories, or homes. Often, the first to be pulled out are girls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to UNICEF, <strong>34% of girls in India are married before the age of 18<\/strong>. Early marriage, domestic chores, and caregiving responsibilities are major contributors to the gender gap in education. Even when girls are enrolled, they are often the first to be withdrawn in times of financial stress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Quality vs. access<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another growing concern is the quality of education. While enrolment numbers may be high, classroom experiences often fail to inspire. Government-funded schools frequently lack updated learning materials and struggle to compete with private institutions in terms of curriculum and engagement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Children who do not see the relevance or value of their education are more likely to disengage and drop out. Over time, education becomes a burden rather than a bridge to opportunity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What needs to change to stop school dropouts?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tackling dropouts requires a holistic approach beginning with infrastructure. Ensuring access to clean toilets, safe drinking water, proper classrooms, and electricity should be non-negotiable. Programmes like the <strong>Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan<\/strong> must be expanded with a stronger focus on infrastructure and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/conducive-learning-environment-for-underserved-children\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">learning environment<\/a> upgrades.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>India also needs more qualified teachers with the time and support to focus solely on education. Regular training, incentives, and fair workloads are key. This investment must be paired with community-level engagement to raise awareness about the importance of education and to reduce parental resistance to sending children\u2014especially girls\u2014to school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Economic barriers must be addressed through scholarships, free uniforms, textbooks, and mid-day meals. Technology should be used to supplement classroom learning, particularly in remote areas where teacher shortages persist. Digital classrooms, learning apps, and recorded lessons can bring continuity to children\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">education<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What\u2019s already working?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>India has made progress. The <strong>Right to Education (RTE) Act<\/strong> guarantees free and compulsory education for children aged 6\u201314, boosting enrolment significantly. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/loss-in-nutrition-due-to-gap-in-mid-day-meals\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Mid-Day Meal Scheme<\/strong> has improved nutrition<\/a> and attendance. Campaigns like <strong>Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao<\/strong> have pushed gender equity in school enrolment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Development organizations, private foundations, and CSR-led interventions are playing a growing role. Organizations are investing in <strong>scholarships, remedial classes, school infrastructure, and teacher training<\/strong>\u2014often filling gaps left by the public system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Changing the narrative<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Addressing dropouts is about giving every child a sense of worth and possibility. Priya\u2019s story isn\u2019t just about a missing toilet; it\u2019s about missed potential. It reflects how a small gap in a system can grow into a life-altering detour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smile Foundation, for instance, works across India to bridge this very gap\u2014bringing together education, community mobilization, and digital tools to help children stay in school and succeed. By investing in such <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">integrated models<\/a>, India can build a future where every child not only enters school but stays, learns, and thrives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To break the dropout cycle, India must ensure that no child is left behind; not because they lacked ambition, but because they lacked a toilet, a teacher, or a chance.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Priya, a 13-year-old from a small village in Jharkhand, loved mathematics and consistently topped her class of 30 students.
