Here in the 21st century, in the enlightened era of robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence etc., we are still discussing the consequences of early-age marriage in a girl\u2019s life despite the global efforts to eradicate it. Latest figures suggest that even today <strong>23% or every one in four girls are married before they could celebrate their 18th birthday<\/strong>.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the era where we have Kalpana Chawla, Marry Kom, PV Sindhu, Falguni Nayar and so many great Indian women thriving in their fields of work, we also have girls who are still fighting for equal educational opportunities and the right to choose their life partner, equal pay and say at the workplace and largely, right to live their life on their terms. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For decades women have been burdened with a lot of expectations and norms to live by, without questioning. Though there has been a lot of development and improvement for women, the race is still not even half done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Early-age marriage disproportionately affects girls, with far-reaching social, economic, <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/health\/\"   title=\"Health\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"1305\">health<\/a>, educational and psychological impacts. It perpetuates gender inequality, limits opportunities and poses significant risks to their health and well-being. Here we will discuss this in detail.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Early-age marriage leads to gender inequality<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Girls who are married at an early age, even before they can think or dream of a bright future are deprived of the basic aspects of life. They are often removed from their peer groups and communities and put into adult roles and responsibilities before they are emotionally or mentally prepared which usually leads to significant psychological stress and trauma. Early-age marriage perpetuates gender inequality and limits a girl\u2019s ability to participate in social, economic and political life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\"   title=\"Education\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2283\">Education<\/a> is a powerful tool that can delay marriage, childbearing and provide better opportunities to women and hence, Girls are often forced to drop out of school, which significantly reduces their future earning potential thus making them financially dependent and the ones with lower authority in decision making.\u00a0 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lack of education limits their critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, making them vulnerable to social evils of the society. This often leads to early childbearing, which can be life-threatening for both mother and the child, leading to long-term health issues, premature delivery, and other pregnancy complications. Lack of awareness and education also contributes to domestic violence, sexual abuse and lack of power to negotiate safe sexual practices. And because of economic dependency and added responsibility of a child forces them to live in a difficult relationship even if it\u2019s abusive, as it becomes difficult for them to support their child and pursue a career post that. And it all becomes a vicious circle of her life even before she realizes it.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The perception: Marrying off early can mean one less mouth to feed and a valuable virgin girl<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In regions where women have limited educational and job opportunities, parents believe that marrying off their daughter early can ensure her economic safety in the future especially when they are poor. The patriarchal society also views it as a means to control women\u2019s sexuality and reproductive rights ensuring that they remain confined in their traditional gender roles which also ensures security from sexual violence in a way. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the cultural norms promote gender-specific roles, they expect girls to marry off early to fulfill their roles as wives and mothers which limits their opportunities for personal growth and development. Societal pressure and traditional beliefs that place a high value on a girl\u2019s virginity compel families to marry their daughters early to ensure they remain \u201cpure\u201d. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sudden transition from childhood to adulthood, coupled with the responsibilities of marriage and motherhood, can be overwhelming and traumatic for young girls. Lack of autonomy, agency and control over their own lives leads to low self-esteem that can have long-term psychological effects, impacting their mental health and overall well-being.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Address the root cause of ending Early Age Marriage<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Implementing solutions to eradicate early-age marriage requires collaborative efforts between government, nonprofits, communities and the society at large to address its root causes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The government has imposed various laws and policies to protect the rights and well-being of girls and to prevent early-age marriage but the legal initiatives are often not enforced effectively. The state has established a minimum legal age for marriage at 18 years, criminalised child marriage and provides legal assistance, counseling and provisions to support girls who are at risk of or subjected to early marriage. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The government also runs regular awareness programmes and campaigns to educate communities about the harms of early marriage and the benefits of delaying marriage. Programmes that provide scholarships, cash transfers or other forms of support can help families prioritise education over marriage. Effective enforcement of laws, strengthening legal frameworks to minimize loopholes and establishing monitoring mechanisms to ensure compliance is crucial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonprofits play a vital role in raising awareness among the communities and individuals as they have the resources and networks to support victims and advocate for stronger enforcement.\u00a0 They work among the masses and understand the ground issues which allows them to address issues that may undermine the effectiveness of the laws.\u00a0 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonprofits empower communities by strengthening systems that protect against child marriage, such as education and social protection. They can also annul child marriages and help survivors recover. They also help in implementing community projects that focus on improving girls\u2019 access to education and healthcare. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Smile Foundation<\/a> also helps <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/women-empowerment\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">empower women<\/a> by spreading awareness about education and women&#8217;s rights reducing the probability of child marriage and improving their self-esteem thus facilitating stronger decision-making.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Community leaders can advocate change<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Working with community leaders, elders and influencers who hold sway in their communities can help shift cultural norms. Providing girls with education and vocational training can empower them to make informed decisions about their lives. When girls are educated and economically independent, they are more likely to resist early marriage. Providing access to reproductive health services and knowledge at community healthcare centers can help girls understand their rights and the health risks associated with early marriage and childbirth more profoundly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Change is a gradual process<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Though people who promote early-age marriage often argue with benefits such as financial stability for the couple where they can combine their resources from an early age; they can be an emotional strength for each other during tough days of adulating; longer time together; and most argued is that women should have an early marriage so they can have kids at the right age. However, considering the long-term implications always weighs the cons on the higher side, thus affecting a girl\u2019s life disproportionately. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Promoting change is a gradual process that requires sustained effort and collaboration among various stakeholders including legal reformers, policymakers, nonprofits, the community and society at large. By addressing the root causes and working within cultural contexts, to ensure that all girls have the opportunity to reach their full potential, it is possible to create a more supportive environment for girls to thrive and live healthy and empowered lives.\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Early-age marriages popularly known as child marriage persist in our country.
