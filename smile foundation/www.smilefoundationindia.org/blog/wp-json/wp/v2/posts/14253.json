With nearly 48% of women still residing in rural areas, their progress remains central to the nation\u2019s broader development. As technology and financial reforms reshape India\u2019s economic landscape, the concern persists \u2014 are rural women advancing alongside the rest of the country, or are they being left behind?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>India has made notable jump through legal reforms, government schemes, corporate collaborations and grassroots NGO efforts that aim to empower women. These initiatives have contributed to safer, more supportive environments for rural women. However, substantial challenges remain. Many rural areas continue to lack the infrastructure, resources and opportunities necessary for inclusive and equitable growth. Among the most urgent concerns are persistent <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/health\/\"   title=\"Health\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2657\">health<\/a> vulnerabilities and financial exclusion, both of which hinder the full participation of rural women in India&#8217;s development journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-her-health-vulnerabilities\"><strong>Her Health Vulnerabilities<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Women in rural India face ongoing health challenges, especially in maternal and reproductive care. Limited access to quality healthcare, preventive screenings and proper nutrition compounds their vulnerability. In Jharkhand, for instance, the Food, Nutrition, Health and WASH programme mobilised <a href=\"https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/city\/ranchi\/health-hygiene-prog-expands-to-263-blocks\/articleshow\/122865171.cms\">3.2 million women<\/a> through self-help groups (SHGs) to promote hygiene and health underscoring the scale of unmet need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S187758452400011X\">National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5)<\/a> reports that over 57% of rural women aged 15\u201349 are anaemic, revealing a serious public health burden. Maternal mortality remains a critical issue, with India recording a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) of 97 per 100,000 live births (2018\u20132020), disproportionately affecting rural regions. At the same time, the rise of non-communicable diseases such as hypertension and diabetes poses growing risks to the long-term well-being of women.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without adequate protection mechanisms, women often delay seeking care due to cost, distance or lack of awareness. This leads to preventable health shocks and higher maternal mortality, further weakening household resilience and relegating women&#8217;s health needs to secondary status.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-her-financial-vulnerabilities\"><strong>Her Financial Vulnerabilities<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the growth of entrepreneurship initiatives targeting rural women, financial exclusion continues to undermine their economic agency. According to a 2023 NITI Aayog report, just 14% of Indian women are engaged in entrepreneurial activity, with even fewer represented in the formal sector. Structural barriers persist, including:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Limited access to institutional credit<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Inadequate digital infrastructure<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Absence of gender-responsive support systems<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Social norms that limit decision-making and ownership<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While women now hold <a href=\"https:\/\/bfsi.economictimes.indiatimes.com\/news\/banking\/women-own-39-2-of-bank-accounts-in-india-42-2-in-rural-areas-government-report\/120057614\">42.2% of rural bank accounts<\/a>, they still face difficulties accessing credit, savings products and digital financial tools. Encouragingly, the number of women borrowers has tripled since 2019, with 60% from rural and semi-urban areas. (<em>From Borrowers to Builders: Women\u2019s Role in India\u2019s Financial Growth Story<\/em>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-systemic-barriers-hindering-her-overall-growth\"><strong>Systemic barriers hindering her overall growth<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond financial and health-related challenges, rural women face systemic barriers at the institutional and community levels, where adequate support is often lacking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cumbersome, bureaucratic loan processes laden with documentation and procedural delays discourage many from pursuing opportunities.<br>The absence of structured mentorship and peer support leaves aspiring entrepreneurs without networks to scale and sustain their businesses.<br>Gender bias and entrenched stereotypes within financial institutions and community settings continue to question women&#8217;s credibility and leadership potential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overcoming these barriers is essential to realising the full potential of rural women. The way forward must involve making social protection accessible to every woman, particularly those in India\u2019s most remote and underserved regions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-understanding-social-protection-for-women-of-rural-communities\"><strong>Understanding social protection for women of rural communities <\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To meaningfully include rural women under the social protection umbrella, we must begin with a clear definition. The International Labour Organisation defines social protection as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ilo.org\/topics-and-sectors\/social-protection\">provision of social security<\/a> in response to life risks such as unemployment, disability and maternity as well as support for those experiencing poverty or social exclusion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This definition reveals that poverty and exclusion disproportionately impact women in rural areas. Globally, over two billion women and girls lack access to any form of social protection. In India, this gap is equally concerning. Even where social protection mechanisms are in place, gender disparities persist. According to UN data, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unwomen.org\/en\/digital-library\/publications\/2024\/10\/world-survey-on-the-role-of-women-in-development-2024\">only 50.1% of women<\/a> access at least one social protection benefit compared to 54.6% of men. Rural women face the highest levels of exclusion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These figures highlight the urgency of developing a robust, gender-responsive social protection framework \u2014 one that not only extends coverage but also propels rural women forward in their journey toward empowerment and economic inclusion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-government-initiatives-supporting-rural-women\"><strong>Government initiatives supporting rural women<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To advance women\u2019s empowerment across rural India, the government has implemented several strategic programmes.
