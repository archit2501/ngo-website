However, even today, millions of children are deprived of access to good-quality education because of socio-economic barriers, systemic inequalities, and general apathy. Within this problem, there is a larger problem that exists \u2013 the gap between girls and boys. The female literacy rate in India stands at 65.46%, significantly lower than the male literacy rate of 80.88%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, several initiatives have ensured that the enrolment of girls in school gets improved. Even then, there are many inequalities that continue to persist. Also, the biggest problem is the retention of girls in the <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\"   title=\"Education\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2445\">education<\/a> system and their transition from school education to college education. This is because the drop-out rates for girls in higher education are more than that of men. This can be owed to factors like child marriage, societal stigma, sanitation facilities, security related issues, family pressure, etc. When the financial condition of a household is poor, it is often the girl child who has to take a step back from education and support in household chores. As per Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2022, 98 percent girls between the ages of 11 to 14 are enrolled in schools, but their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.collegesearch.in\/articles\/education-for-girls\">dropout rates increase<\/a> as they enter higher grades.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This highlights the importance of ensuring that every girl has access to formal education and the barriers preventing that from happening need to be removed. Every girl deserves a classroom, as a space for learning, as a gateway to empowerment, equality, and opportunity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Importance of girl child education<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While it is understood that education is crucial for growth and development of both girls and boys, and we are not suggesting that any one of them need to be prioritized more; why we are talking about education for girls is the systematic differences that exist between the two genders. Educating girls is both a matter of individual empowerment and also a tool of societal transformation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Here\u2019s why girl child education is so important<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Independence and empowerment: <\/strong>Girls who receive proper education have the knowledge and skills to become financially independent and also to take informed decisions about their wellbeing. A financially independent woman can very well become the decision-maker of her life breaking away from her earlier assumed subservient roles.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/health\/\"   title=\"Health\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"1441\">Health<\/a> and well-being: <\/strong>This is also true that girls who receive an education are able to make the right decisions when it comes to their health and well-being. Not just that, they also support their families in making the right decisions. This is because educated mothers are more likely to seek medical care for themselves and their children. This helps in reducing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unicef.org\/education\/girls-education\">maternal and child mortality rates<\/a>.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Gender equality: <\/strong>This is a given; when girls are educated, they are able to stand shoulder to shoulder with boys. They challenge traditional gender roles and break stereotypes. For example, educated women may choose to support the family financially instead of taking care of the household. Education also empowers girls to assert their rights, seek legal help, and participate actively in the political and social sphere.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Broader impact of educating girls<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Economic Growth: <\/strong>When women receive good education, they are able to enter the workforce, become entrepreneurs, and also bring new innovation to the industries they work in. This way, they help the nation\u2019s economy to grow at a faster pace. According to the World Bank, closing gender gaps in education and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rawatgirlscollege.com\/blog\/importance-of-girl-education-in-india\">labour force participation<\/a> could add $12 trillion to global GDP by 2025.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Development of Society:<\/strong> When it comes to participation in community development, public discourse, or fighting for social change and challenging harmful practices, the ones who are empowered can do it. Educated girls are more likely to challenge harmful practices like child marriage, gender-based violence, etc. This way they help in creating a more inclusive society.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Society\u2019s moral obligation towards girls<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All of us have a moral obligation to ensure every girl in this country finds a classroom. Educating children is a matter of justice, dignity, and human rights. When we deny our girls access to education, we perpetuate the cycle of discrimination, inequality, and social injustice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a number of initiatives that have been taken in India to ensure that girl education is promoted.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP):<\/strong> Launched in 2015, this government programme aims to address the declining child sex ratio and promote education and empowerment of girls. It focuses on awareness campaigns, community mobilization, and improving access to education.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBV): <\/strong>This scheme provides <a href=\"https:\/\/www.orfonline.org\/expert-speak\/empowering-nations-educating-girls-for-economic-growth-and-equality\">residential schools<\/a> for girls from disadvantaged communities, ensuring access to quality education in rural and backward areas.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY): <\/strong>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/girl-child-education-for-economic-growth-and-equality\/\">savings scheme<\/a> that encourages families to invest in their daughters\u2019 education and future, offering financial security and incentives.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>National Scheme of Incentives to Girls for Secondary Education (NSIGSE): <\/strong>This programme provides <a href=\"https:\/\/dsel.education.gov.in\/nsigse\">financial incentives<\/a> to girls from marginalized communities to complete secondary education.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from these initiatives by the government, there are many contributions made by non-government organizations (NGOs) and the private sector as well. There are several initiatives that work towards ensuring good quality education for not just girls, but every child.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The way forward: What needs to be done for girl child<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from ensuring access to education and classrooms, we also need to work towards maintaining the quality of this education, creating employment opportunities, and much more. Here are some of the things that need urgent attention:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The primary focus should be on reducing the dropout rate for girls as they reach higher grades. This can only be addressed through awareness campaigns, community involvement, and providing incentives for families to support their girl child\u2019s education until she receives higher education. Providing scholarships, menstrual hygiene products, and safe transportation can make a significant difference.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Secondly, there is a major need to invest in education infrastructure so that more and more schools and higher education institutions of quality are present across the country, and the girls do not have to travel long distances to receive education. Additionally, libraries and digital classrooms should be established in existing institutions as well.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Leverage technology to provide online learning opportunities and bridge the digital divide. Initiatives like Digital India can be expanded to include e-learning platforms for girls in remote areas.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Since educating girls is not dependent on just one person, we need to involve parents and community leaders in promoting this. As mentioned above, awareness campaigns need to be run and incentives need to be created for families.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lastly, the most important is the continuous strengthening of policies that support and promote education of girls. Also, the existing policies need to be implemented in a better way so that there are no gaps that exist. Regular monitoring and evaluation is also needed to assess the impact of the initiatives, and changes should be made according to the need.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Every girl deserves a classroom\u2014not just as a space for learning but as a platform for empowerment, equality, and opportunity. Educating girls is not just an investment in their future but a commitment to building a better world for all. It is a moral obligation, an economic necessity, and a social imperative. As India strives to achieve its development goals, <a href=\"https:\/\/donate.smilefoundationindia.org\/donate-for-girl-child\">prioritizing girl child education<\/a> will be key to unlocking the nation\u2019s full potential.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Indian constitution has made education a fundamental right.
