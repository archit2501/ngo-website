Its beauty lies in the endless ways it can manifest \u2014 through small moments of joy, acts of kindness, and the simple act of a smile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On World Happiness Day, Smile Foundation celebrates its ongoing commitment to spreading smiles across India through comprehensive interventions in education, health, women empowerment, and livelihood. The foundation believes that true happiness stems from the security of good <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/health\/\"   title=\"Health\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"1430\">health<\/a>, access to quality education, and opportunities for economic independence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite India\u2019s progress, 25.01% of the population still lives below the poverty line (NITI Aayog, 2023), struggling to meet basic essentials. Additionally, 18% of women lack access to maternal healthcare (UNICEF, 2023). Addressing these gaps, Smile Foundation\u2019s holistic approach supports vulnerable communities, fostering inclusive growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the support of corporate and community partners, Smile Foundation transforms lives, nurturing self-reliance and resilience and therefore, this World Happiness Day, Smile reaffirms its dedication to building a healthier, happier India, where every smile is a step towards collective well-being.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Lifecycle Approach: From Smile to Happiness<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a country as diverse as India, the meaning of happiness varies for each individual.
