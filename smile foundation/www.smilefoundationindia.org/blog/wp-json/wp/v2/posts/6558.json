Acting as a catalyst for the digital revolution, artificial intelligence has spread like a raging phenomenon across the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Artificial Intelligence in Today\u2019s World<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Artificial intelligence is the most budding field providing plenty of profitable job opportunities and the youth today are interested to shape their careers in it. There is an ever-growing demand for skilled AI workers due to it rapidly changing the way industries work.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI utilizes two broad aspects \u2013 machine learning and deep learning, to perform tasks and provide results. It employs the data that is provided to it and generates outputs accordingly. The outputs provided by AI are up to the level that people have started fearing job security. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/hollywood-wga-strike-artificial-intelligence\/\">Hollywood writers<\/a> are currently protesting against the complete adoption of AI tools threatening their jobs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We must understand that artificial intelligence should be utilized in a way that empowers humans rather than threatens them. It is a powerful tool and countries across the world have become aware of the leveraging capabilities AI has on the economy, and how important it is to invest in them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>To Invest or Not To Invest?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With first-world countries like the USA making considerable progress in the field of artificial intelligence, is it becoming difficult for Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) to keep up?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Artificial intelligence, although an extremely important and helpful tool that can help these countries grow, is <a href=\"https:\/\/theconversation.com\/developing-countries-are-being-left-behind-in-the-ai-race-and-thats-a-problem-for-all-of-us-180218\">extremely costly<\/a>. With major concerns of LMICs revolving around <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\"   title=\"Education\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"1993\">education<\/a>, Primary Healthcare (PHC), poverty, and curbing hunger, the developed nations are better positioned to invest in artificial intelligence and machine learning generally leaving the developing nations unable to afford the huge amount the AI infrastructure costs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although, this also remains true that investment in AI will prove to be highly beneficial for the LMICs. They can help boost employment rates in the field, ease agriculture for hard-working farmers, and make healthcare accessible among other objectives.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How can AI Empower LMICs<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The progress artificial intelligence has made and the potential it still has makes it an effective tool to alleviate poverty and hunger, better healthcare facilities, provide quality education, and leverage the economic development of a country.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A California-based company, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/drones-have-transformed-blood-delivery-in-rwanda\/\">Zipline<\/a>, has started delivery of medication and blood to countries like Rwanda, Ghana, Japan, and the United States. The healthcare sector in India too has been impacted by AI. Microsoft\u2019s Healthcare AI network and Apollo Hospitals are focusing on using machine models to predict heart attacks. It helps doctors reduce the cognitive burden while operating, and by providing critical and concise information it helps in early detection and consequently, prediction of diseases.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to healthcare, education too will be made accessible and affordable by using AI, especially after the pandemic when digitization has been more normalized than it ever was. AI has the power to address the biggest challenges education presently faces. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one challenge AI is currently facing is the lack of human touch and that needs to be corrected so that technology doesn\u2019t reflect personal biases, because that in turn will prove to be a hindrance to education. A human-centric approach to AI is imperative so that the world doesn\u2019t have to see another <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/BL-DGB-42522\">software mistaking humans for gorillas.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another use of AI is being seen in curbing climate change. Mitigation of forest fires, floods, and other natural disasters is being looked into with the use of AI.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>India too has started taking steps to adopt AI for objectives other than military and defense. The country implemented a National Strategy for AI discussion in 2018 that mainly focuses on sectors like healthcare, education, and <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/livelihood\/\"   title=\"Livelihood\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"519\">livelihood<\/a> to empower the citizens and develop smart cities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>AI and Nonprofits<\/strong><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds transformative potential for nonprofits, reshaping our strategies and amplifying our impact. By leveraging AI tools and techniques, nonprofits can operate more efficiently, make data-driven decisions, and engage with beneficiaries, donors, and volunteers, in innovative ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonprofits deal with limited resources, and AI can help determine where funds, manpower, and efforts are most needed. By analyzing data and identifying trends, AI ensures that resources are allocated strategically to achieve maximum impact and advance the nonprofit&#8217;s mission.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The power of data analysis is another domain where AI shines. AI can process vast amounts of data quickly, extracting valuable insights that guide decision-making. Nonprofits can use AI to uncover trends, evaluate program effectiveness, and fine-tune their strategies for better outcomes. This data-driven approach enhances the overall efficiency and efficacy of nonprofit operations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Program delivery and efficiency can be enhanced through AI automation. Routine tasks can be automated, freeing up staff to focus on high-value activities. Chatbots, for instance, can handle common queries, manage scheduling, and provide information, improving operational efficiency and ensuring smoother interactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Measuring impact is a crucial aspect of nonprofit work, and AI can help in this realm as well. AI tools can analyze various data sources to provide a more accurate assessment of a nonprofit&#8217;s outcomes and effectiveness. This data-driven approach to impact measurement is instrumental in demonstrating accountability to stakeholders, donors, and the community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Volunteer engagement can also benefit from AI technology. AI algorithms can match volunteers&#8217; skills, interests, and availability with specific tasks or projects, streamlining the volunteer management process and maximizing their contributions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Road Ahead<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Incorporating AI into nonprofits comes with ethical considerations and data privacy concerns. Nonprofits must collaborate with tech experts, ensure transparency, and align AI deployment with their values and mission. As nonprofits embrace AI&#8217;s potential, they stand to unlock new avenues for positive change and create lasting impact in the communities we serve.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The term artificial intelligence goes back to 1956 when John McCarthy coined it in a proposal for the Dartmouth Conference, and since then, artificial intelligence, or AI, has significantly transformed the world.
