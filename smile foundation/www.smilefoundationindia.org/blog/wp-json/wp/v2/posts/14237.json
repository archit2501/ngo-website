It\u2019s one of those timeless proverbs that families pass down, a reminder of how deeply education is valued in our culture. The phrase became even more popular after Asha Bhosale sang it in the 1958 film <em><strong>Malik<\/strong><\/em>. Back then, just a decade after independence, this wasn\u2019t just a catchy line \u2013 it echoed a national belief that <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\"   title=\"Education\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2650\">education<\/a> ( a means for good employability) wasn\u2019t just good for the individual, it was essential for building the future of the country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a newly sovereign India grappling with poverty, illiteracy, and social fragmentation, this proverb encapsulated a powerful aspiration. It signified hope for millions, who saw education as the primary vehicle for socioeconomic transformation. The imagery of the nawab as in the phrase was not literal but symbolic \u2013 it represented dignity, status and participation in the democratic promise of postcolonial India. The assumption was that an educated populace would serve as the vanguard of progress and modernity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But today, that hopeful vision needs a closer look. Sure, more kids are in school than ever before, but just getting an education isn\u2019t always enough. The big question now is: are we preparing young people for real jobs and real opportunities? For many, the link between schooling and a meaningful livelihood still feels weak. It\u2019s time to rethink what we\u2019re teaching, how we\u2019re teaching it, and whether it\u2019s truly setting students up for success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-addressing-the-massive-gap\"><strong>Addressing the massive gap<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s the tough reality: in India today, getting a degree doesn\u2019t always lead to a job. In fact, more education can sometimes mean fewer chances at employment. Sounds backwards, but the numbers say it all. According to Azim Premji University\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/azimpremjiuniversity.edu.in\/the-indian-economy\/state-of-working-india-2023\"><em>State of Working India 2023<\/em> <\/a>report, nearly <strong>43% of graduates under 25<\/strong> are unemployed. That\u2019s twice the rate of those who stopped at secondary school. Some states are seeing this gap even more sharply with Andhra Pradesh having more than 35% of graduates jobless in late 2022. Even more telling is that the graduates made up a whopping 73% of the state\u2019s total unemployed. It\u2019s a worrying sign that our education system isn\u2019t connecting with the job market, and young people are paying the price.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can really see this disconnect playing out in real life. In Uttar Pradesh, government job openings for low-skill roles, like messengers or railway porters, which need only a 5th or 10th-grade education recently saw <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ndtv.com\/india-news\/railways-jobs-jobs-in-railways-indian-railways-had-63-000-job-openings-19-million-people-applied-1974696\">hundreds of thousands of applicants<\/a>. But the catch is many of them were postgraduates, MBAs, even PhDs. When highly educated people line up for jobs that don\u2019t need those qualifications, it\u2019s a clear sign that something\u2019s broken. The deeper issue is whether our education system is preparing people for the kind of work that actually exists or not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-recognising-impediments-in-the-process-of-employability\"><strong>Recognising impediments in the process of employability <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/resources.mettl.com\/research\/india-graduate-skill-index-2025\/\">Mercer-Mettl Graduate Skill Index 2025<\/a><\/strong>, only 42.6% of Indian graduates are considered employable, down from 44.3% in 2023. It&#8217;s a worrying trend that reflects a growing disconnect between education and what the job market actually needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A big part of the problem is the way many universities still operate. Rote learning and outdated syllabi leave little room for building relevant skills. Students rarely get to work with technologies that are reshaping the world of work like artificial intelligence, data analytics, cloud computing or cybersecurity. They earn degrees, but not necessarily the capabilities that help them thrive at work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Practical experience is often missing too. Internships, live projects and apprenticeships are still not mainstream in higher education. This means graduates often step into the workforce without ever having worked in a real-world setting. On top of that, soft skills like communication, critical thinking and teamwork don\u2019t get the attention they deserve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The employability gap widens further when you consider regional disparities, gender gaps and the slow rate of job creation. For many young people, especially in underserved areas, it\u2019s about access and opportunity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To change this, we need much closer collaboration between industry and academia. Course design should involve employers. Students need hands-on learning built into their programmes. And soft skills training should be as essential as technical knowledge. We also need to explore new approaches that respond to fast-changing market needs and help young people build their own paths \u2013 whether that\u2019s in jobs or entrepreneurship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-building-real-world-solutions-for-more-employability-in-india\"><strong>Building real world solutions<\/strong> <strong>for more employability in India<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The growing gap between college degrees and job readiness can\u2019t be ignored. While government-led skilling schemes and education reforms are an important part of the solution, they aren\u2019t enough on their own. What\u2019s needed is a more collaborative approach, one that brings in civil society, NGOs and community-based organisations that work directly with young people, especially those from underserved backgrounds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take Smile Foundation\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/livelihood\/\">STeP (Smile Twin e-Learning Programme)<\/a>, for example. It\u2019s designed to equip young people with both the technical and soft skills they need to get into the workforce. Beyond training, STeP also offers career counselling to help participants make informed, realistic choices about their future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between 2023 and 2024, over 9,000 young people were trained through the STeP programme. Of these, 550 went on to secure jobs across a range of industries. We also conducted more than 800 career counselling sessions and organised multiple industry exposure visits, giving participants a real sense of what different workplaces are like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Support doesn\u2019t end once someone completes the training or gets placed. STeP offers continued guidance \u2013 from confidence-building and interview prep to post-placement support so that young people feel equipped to stay and grow in the jobs they land.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initiatives like this show that employability is also about helping young people build aspirations, understand their options and connect to opportunities that often lie just out of reach.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you grew up in northern India, chances are you\u2019ve heard the saying Padhoge Likhoge Banoge Nawab (study hard and you\u2019ll go far in life).
