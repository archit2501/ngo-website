Punjab\u2019s rural communities, home to ~17.9 million people, face a 20% shortfall in health sub-centres, fewer Primary Health Centres (PHCs) than needed, and a huge gap in Community Health Centres (CHCs)<strong>.<\/strong> As a result, each rural sub-centre in Punjab serves on average 6,258 people (vs the national norm of 5,000) and each PHC covers 45,000 people (vs norm 30,000). These shortages are compounded by severe workforce gaps \u2013 for instance, rural CHCs in Punjab have <a href=\"https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/city\/chandigarh\/punjabs-healthcare-crisis-insufficient-facilities-and-doctor-shortage\/articleshow\/113376848.cms#:~:text=%2852,lives%20in%20the%20rural%20areas\">only 55 specialist doctors<\/a> against 336 required (over 80% vacancy).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many facilities also lack basics like electricity and water: in 2023, 299 of Punjab\u2019s 2,857 rural sub-centres had no electric supply and dozens lacked running water. This infrastructure deficit undermines service quality and deters healthcare utilisation, especially among vulnerable groups (women, children, the elderly). It reflects a broader inequity. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Globally, 56% of people in rural areas do not have access to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S2213398424001805#:~:text=,access%20to%20essential%20healthcare%20services\">essential health services<\/a>, contributing to worse health outcomes and avoidable mortality. Bridging these gaps in accessibility is crucial for India\u2019s commitment to Universal <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/health\/\" title=\"Health\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2527\">Health<\/a> Coverage (UHC) and health equity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Telemedicine has emerged as an effective solution to the rural healthcare crisis, by breaking geographical barriers and bringing medical expertise virtually to underserved areas. India\u2019s national telemedicine platform <strong>eSanjeevani<\/strong> exemplifies this potential \u2013 since launching in 2019, it has facilitated <a href=\"https:\/\/m.economictimes.com\/industry\/healthcare\/biotech\/healthcare\/over-34-crore-patients-provided-consultation-through-esanjeevani-platform-rajya-sabha-told\/articleshow\/118149172.cms#:~:text=Since%20its%20launch%20in%202019%2C,said%20responding%20to%20a%20question\">over 34 crore (340 million) consultations<\/a> as of Feb 2025, connecting remote patients with doctors and specialists. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine proved indispensable in maintaining care continuity in remote regions. The Government\u2019s two-pronged eSanjeevani system \u2013 AB-HWC (Ayushman Bharat-Health and Wellness Centre) for provider-to-provider consultations via Community Health Officers (CHOs) at rural clinics, and OPD for direct patient-to-doctor online visits \u2013 has helped ensure availability, accessibility and affordability of healthcare across India. However, leveraging telehealth at scale also requires robust digital infrastructure, training, and community trust. Studies indicate that without adequate training and protocols, telemedicine referrals can be sub-optimal, and limited digital literacy or connectivity in rural areas remains a barrier. Addressing these challenges is essential to realise telemedicine\u2019s full impact. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Punjab, with relatively high mobile penetration and improving broadband reach, is well-positioned to benefit from telehealth innovations \u2013 provided the rural clinics are upgraded with power supply, internet, and skilled staff. This is the context in which Smile Foundation\u2019s telemedicine initiative in Moga district, Punjab, was conceived as a public-private partnership model to strengthen rural primary care delivery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-smile-foundation-telemedicine-initiative-in-moga-punjab\"><strong>Smile Foundation telemedicine initiative in Moga, Punjab<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Moga, Punjab<\/strong> \u2013 identified under India\u2019s Aspirational Blocks Programme for its lagging health indicators became the focus of a telemedicine-led healthcare strengthening project in 2023-24. Smile Foundation, in collaboration with the Health Department of Punjab, and corporate partner SBI Cards, launched a comprehensive telemedicine initiative to bolster primary <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/resolving-remote-rural-healthcare-needs-through-static-clinics\/\" title=\"Resolving Remote Rural Healthcare Needs Through Static Clinics\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2605\">healthcare in Moga\u2019s rural<\/a> blocks. This model builds on Smile Foundation\u2019s prior success in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/telemedicine-project-in-nuh-haryana-easing-healthcare-access\/\">Nuh (Haryana)<\/a>, adapting it to local needs in Punjab. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project\u2019s core intervention is the establishment of <strong>12 e-Arogya Telemedicine Clinics<\/strong> at government Health and Wellness Centres (sub-centres) across Moga. Each clinic is equipped with a telemedicine kiosk, digital diagnostics (point-of-care devices), and a Medicine Vending Machine (MVM) for instant dispensing of essential drugs prescribed during tele-consultations. Crucially, the project invested in <strong>infrastructure upgrades<\/strong> and identified sub-centres were refurbished along with outfitting of solar power units in them to ensure 24\u00d77 electricity, and providing reliable internet connectivity to support uninterrupted tele-consultation sessions. This approach directly addressed the basic facility gaps, like electricity, that previously hindered digital health services in Punjab\u2019s villages. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/DSC02221-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13951\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/DSC02221-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/DSC02221-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/DSC02221-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/DSC02221-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/DSC02221-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/DSC02221-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/DSC02221-1980x1320.jpg 1980w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>By December 2023, necessary government approvals were obtained and the telemedicine units were integrated with the national <strong>eSanjeevani<\/strong> platform, aligning the project with the Ministry of Health\u2019s digital health ecosystem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-capacity-building-and-community-engagement\"><strong>Capacity-building and community engagement<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Capacity-building and community engagement form a major pillar of the Moga initiative.

Nuh, a predominantly rural and socio-economically challenged area (ranked among India\u2019s Aspirational Districts), saw its first Smile telemedicine unit launched in May 2021. By mid-2023, this had expanded to 10 e-Arogya clinics across 8 PHC areas in Nuh, covering a population of about 10 lakh (1 million). The results have been remarkable in enhancing healthcare utilisation and equity. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a one-year period (April 2022\u2013March 2023), Nuh\u2019s telemedicine centres facilitated 32,789 doctor consultations for villagers who otherwise face barriers to access. Importantly, over 53% of patients were repeat users (multiple visits), indicating high satisfaction and trust in the quality of care. The telemedicine clinics also integrated NCD screenings into their workflow, leading to thousands being screened for diabetes, hypertension, and other conditions per government protocols, with data reported into the public health system for follow-up. Such integration with the national NCD programme means earlier detection and referral of cases (e.g. identifying hypertensive patients who were unaware of their condition), reinforcing primary care\u2019s gatekeeping role.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"qa-section\">\n  <h2>\ud83d\udcac Ask a CHO: Your Questions Answered<\/h2>\n\n  <div class=\"qa-card\">\n    <button class=\"qa-question\" onclick=\"toggleAnswer(this)\">\n      What is a telemedicine consultation like in a village?\n    <\/button>\n    <div class=\"qa-answer\">\n      Patients visit their local health centre, where I connect them with a qualified doctor via the eSanjeevani platform.

Of the 35,000+ individuals directly benefitting from the telemedicine clinics in Nuh\u2019s first two years, <strong>52% were women<\/strong> \u2013 a notable achievement in a conservative region where women\u2019s healthcare-seeking outside the home was very limited. Community women who \u201ccould not think of going outside the village\u201d for care were now comfortably accessing medical consultations virtually in their local clinic. This reflects how telemedicine can overcome socio-cultural barriers by providing primary care delivery in a familiar setting. Patients received not only primary consultations but also referral support: the telehealth system in Nuh is linked with higher centres \u2013 about 2\u20133% of cases each quarter were referred to secondary\/tertiary hospitals for issues needing in-person intervention, with the telemedicine staff facilitating these referrals. By managing the bulk of routine ailments and follow-ups at village level, the project helped decongest higher hospitals and cut down out-of-pocket expenditures (e.g. travel costs) for the community. Local health officials in Nuh noted a visible increase in outpatient footfall at the upgraded sub-centres due to telemedicine and NCD services, which in turn meant earlier treatment and better monitoring of chronic conditions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-strengthening-of-the-public-health-system\"><strong>Strengthening of the public health system<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another key outcome from Nuh has been the strengthening of the public health system through collaboration. The telemedicine units were eventually integrated into the government\u2019s eSanjeevani network and handed over to the District Health Administration for sustainable operations. All 10 units in Nuh are now run as part of the Ayushman Bharat-Health and Wellness Centre scheme, with trained CHOs managing the teleconsultations \u2013 effectively institutionalising the innovation. This sustainability plan was built in by Smile Foundation from the start: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>\u201cWe focus on setting up telemedicine clinics under a PPP model and later handing them over to the government to operate,\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>noted Mr. Santanu Mishra, Co-Founder of Smile Foundation. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, the Nuh telemedicine project was recognised nationally, winning the <strong>ASSOCHAM \u201cBest <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/corporate-partnership\/\" title=\"Corporate Partnerships\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2528\">CSR<\/a> Excellence in Healthcare\u201d Award in 2023<\/strong> for its impact in an aspirational district. Punjab\u2019s Moga initiative is following the same trajectory. Initial indications show improved health awareness and service uptake in target villages of Moga. The project has set quarterly targets (e.g. ~4,300 teleconsultations per quarter by late 2024, scaling to ~10,000+ per quarter by late 2025), and will similarly be evaluated on reductions in patient travel, better management of NCDs, and patient satisfaction. Already, the collaborative training and enhanced infrastructure have prepared Moga\u2019s health sub-centres to function as \u201cmodel health and wellness centres\u201d, offering a broader range of services than before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/DSC01819-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13956\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/DSC01819-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/DSC01819-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/DSC01819-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/DSC01819-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/DSC01819-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/DSC01819-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/06\/DSC01819-1980x1320.jpg 1980w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-toward-equitable-and-scalable-primary-care-delivery-models\"><strong>Toward equitable and scalable <strong>primary care delivery<\/strong> models<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The telemedicine model in Moga, and previously in Nuh, highlights how digital health can catalyse equitable healthcare delivery when combined with investments in primary care and community engagement. These interventions directly contribute to national health goals and international targets. By bringing doctors to the remotest communities virtually, such projects are \u201censuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages,\u201d advancing <strong>Sustainable Development Goal 3 on health<\/strong>. They operationalise the Indian government\u2019s vision under the National Health Policy 2017 and Ayushman Bharat: namely, leveraging digital technology to increase access, improve quality, and reduce the cost of healthcare delivery. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) provides a supportive framework for interoperability and electronic health records, which the Moga telemedicine clinics are utilising to generate digital health records and share data on NCDs with state systems. Notably, Moga\u2019s inclusion in the Aspirational Blocks Programme means it receives coordinated support to uplift health indicators \u2013 WHO India is one of the partners in this effort, focusing on primary health care strengthening and capacity building in Punjab\u2019s aspirational blocks. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-power-of-public-private-partnership-ppp-model\"><strong>The power of public-private partnership (PPP) model<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Smile Foundation initiative dovetails with this by addressing service delivery gaps on the ground. It demonstrates a scalable public-private partnership (PPP) model: the private sector (NGO and CSR funding) innovates and pilots the service, while the public sector provides facilities, integrates the services into its schemes, and sustains them long-term. Such models can be replicated in other under-served districts and blocks. Indeed, the Government of India is expanding telehealth through eSanjeevani to all 1.5 lakh Health and Wellness Centres nationally, learning from these pilots.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital infrastructure is now recognised as a critical determinant of health access. Moga\u2019s project showed that investing in basics like power and internet connectivity for rural clinics is a pre-requisite to digital health solutions \u2013 a lesson for scalability. As rural broadband improves under programmes like BharatNet, telemedicine\u2019s reach will further expand. However, human infrastructure is just as important: continuous training for health workers, digital literacy for patients, and trust-building in communities are vital for success. The Moga initiative\u2019s use of local language educational materials and involving community leaders (Panchayats, village health committees) has been key to winning acceptance \u2013 villagers see the telemedicine clinic as an extension of the public health system, not a foreign technology. This community-centric approach aligns with WHO\u2019s emphasis on people-centred primary care and reducing rural-urban health disparities. The World Economic Forum has lauded India\u2019s digital health progress, noting that &#8220;telemedicine platforms are overcoming geographical barriers and reaching remote populations with quality care, thus bridging healthcare disparities.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-reaching-the-last-mile\"><strong>Reaching the last mile<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, Smile Foundation\u2019s telemedicine initiative in Moga, Punjab exemplifies a data-driven, collaborative strategy to strengthen rural health systems. Early evidence and comparative insights from Nuh indicate that such interventions can substantially improve health system accessibility, by providing \u201clast-mile\u201d connectivity for medical services, enhance primary healthcare delivery through comprehensive services at the community level, and build digital health infrastructure that leaves a lasting impact. With supportive policy integration, these models contribute to a more equitable healthcare framework \u2013 one where a villager in Moga or Nuh can access timely, quality medical advice as readily as someone in a city. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Punjab and India at large work towards universal health coverage, scaling up successful telemedicine-public health hybrids could very well be a game-changer for underserved regions. The Moga telemedicine project, supported by multi-sectoral partnerships and aligned with national programmes, is not only delivering care today but also providing a <strong>proof-of-concept for sustainable, tech-enabled primary healthcare<\/strong> that can be reproduced across India\u2019s aspirational districts and beyond. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By addressing both the supply-side (infrastructure, providers) and demand-side (community awareness, affordability) barriers, it charts a path toward bridging the rural health divide and ensuring that geography is no longer destiny when it comes to primary care delivery access.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sources:<\/strong> Punjab rural health statistics; Smile Foundation reports and press releases; WHO\/WEF analyses; Government data on eSanjeevani.
