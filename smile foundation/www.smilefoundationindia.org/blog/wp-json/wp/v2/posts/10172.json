The digitalisation of learning, the introduction of STEM and FLN initiatives, and various government schemes, including those focused on girl child education, are reshaping the system into a more inclusive model. This evolving framework aims to provide every child with access to quality education, equipping them for sustainable and stable futures. In this context, corporate social partnerships have played a pivotal role in advancing education in underserved communities. By investing in school infrastructure, providing educational resources, and collaborating closely with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NGOs for education<\/a>, corporates have ensured that quality learning reaches countless children across the country<strong>.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Current India\u2019s Educational Portfolio<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the<a href=\"https:\/\/asercentre.org\/aser-2023-beyond-basics\/\"> ASER 2023 report<\/a>, 86.8% of youth aged 14-18 are now enrolled in educational institutions. This finding is based on a comprehensive survey conducted across 28 districts in 26 states, encompassing a total of 34,745 individuals in this age group. While these figures indicate progress, the goal of achieving universal school enrolment remains unmet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge the significant strides made in improving educational access for children from underserved communities. This progress is evident when compared to earlier years, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unicef.org\/india\/what-we-do\/education\">with an estimated 6.1 million children out of school in 2014 and 13.46 million in 2006.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such advancements highlight the impact of strategic and collaborative efforts of government and corporate social partnerships-to strengthen India\u2019s educational infrastructure holistically and for all. These efforts aim to ensure that every child, regardless of gender, caste, or socio-economic background, has the opportunity to attend school and benefit from advanced educational resources and opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>CSR in Education in India<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/corporate-partnership\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Corporate Social Responsibility<\/a> (CSR) initiatives in India have emerged as a vital pillar of social development. Since its introduction as a mandatory requirement in 2013, CSR has seen significant investment by corporates, particularly in the education sector, playing a crucial role in delivering quality education to some of the most remote areas of the country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, given India\u2019s growing population and the evolving demands of the professional market, it is imperative to focus on equipping young minds with holistic learning, critical thinking skills, and vocational training. These elements are essential to provide a competitive advantage in line with emerging job trends, ensuring that education driven by CSR continues to meet the needs of a dynamic future workforce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Corporate Social Partnerships can help?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Corporate Social Partnerships between businesses and NGOs have emerged as a transformative force in making quality education accessible to underserved communities across India.<a href=\"https:\/\/thecsrjournal.in\/corporate-social-responsibility-csr-news-top-companies-education\/\"> Initiatives<\/a> such as <strong>&#8220;Literacy as a Service&#8221; (LaaS)<\/strong> by Tata Consultancy Services and the <strong>Dhirubhai Ambani Scholarship Programme (DAS)<\/strong> by Reliance Foundation exemplify the potential of such collaborations in driving educational progress and equity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, taking inspiration from the above pioneers of corporate social partnerships, going forward the aim must be to achieve sustainable and impactful outcomes. Thus, Corporate Social Partnerships in education must focus on the following key principles:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Achieving Shared Value<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>As a signatory of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), India is committed to ensuring every child has access to quality education. Corporate Social Partnerships must align with this vision, fostering collaboration to make quality learning both affordable and accessible to underserved communities. By prioritising shared value with the government\u2019s educational schemes and policies, corporates and NGOs, through corporate social partnerships can amplify their collective impact, bridging gaps in educational equity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Corporate Accountability for Responsible Business<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The essence of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) lies in collectively building resilient communities for a stronger nation. CSR must extend beyond compliance with mandates and evolve into a core business value. Corporates that integrate social responsibility into their business ethos demonstrate a deeper commitment to societal progress while building meaningful connections with consumers as accountable and responsible entities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Sustainability within Communities<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Underserved communities in India are diverse and geographically dispersed. While government initiatives have been instrumental in improving educational infrastructure, deeper engagement is required to address grassroots challenges. NGOs, with their close connection to local issues, cultural norms, and unique community needs, are pivotal in this effort.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Corporate social partnerships can strengthen these efforts, enabling a more nuanced approach to addressing educational disparities. Such partnerships are not only instrumental in driving change but also in creating sustainable development within communities, ensuring long-term benefits for future generations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When strategically aligned, Corporate social partnerships between NGOs and Corporates hold the potential to transform India\u2019s education landscape, ensuring every child, irrespective of their background, is empowered to learn, grow, and thrive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/\"><strong> Smile Foundation<\/strong><\/a>, a social development organisation has been working closely with global corporates for the underserved communities of India since 2005. Our &#8220;<strong>Life-Cycle Approach&#8221;<\/strong> is designed to empower underserved children and communities across India by providing access to quality education, healthcare, <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/livelihood\/\"   title=\"Livelihood\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"593\">livelihood<\/a> training, and women\u2019s empowerment. This comprehensive strategy positively impacts over 1.5 million individuals annually across 2,000 villages in 25 states.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Empowering Lives with a Holistic Approach<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key initiatives include <strong>Mission Education<\/strong>, which strengthens foundational skills in language, numeracy through FLN, and STEM education, aligned with the National Education Policy to prepare children for future success. Our <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/health\/\"   title=\"Health\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"1387\">health<\/a> initiative <strong>Smile on Wheels (SOWs)<\/strong> brings mobile healthcare services, offering OPD consultations, diagnostic tests, and free medications to remote areas. <strong>Swabhiman<\/strong> focuses on maternal, menstrual, and neonatal health, delivering essential reproductive care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Programs such as <strong>STeP<\/strong> and <strong>Swabhiman<\/strong> provide vocational training, equipping youth and women with skills for employability, entrepreneurship, and economic independence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Transformative Corporate Social Partnerships<\/strong><\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>We have partnered with over 400 global brands to drive impactful CSR initiatives. These collaborations have enabled the upliftment of marginalised communities by providing quality education, healthcare, and livelihood opportunities, with a special focus on empowering women, young girls, and children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our Life-Cycle Approach offers tailored corporate social partnerships to address systemic issues like poverty, inequality, and lack of basic services, creating sustainable progress and measurable outcomes that can empower underserved communities of India, the opportunity and resources to become self-reliant and sustainable communities.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s partner to create remarkable positive change in the lives of innocent children by giving them the gift of education and spreading boundless smiles.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>India&#8217;s educational landscape has undergone a significant transformation.
