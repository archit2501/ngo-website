He is an institution unto himself, admired by millions in India and across the world. There are many stories from his life that highlight the purity of his character. One such anecdote illustrates his humility and compassion. In 1998, after the <a href=\"https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/industry\/auto\/auto-news\/tata-indica-a-classic-example-of-innovation-that-redefined-the-indian-car-market\/articleshow\/81287858.cms\">Tata Indica<\/a> was launched, it faced a lot of criticism and poor reviews from the customers. As a reaction to this, many experts advised that Ratan Tata should sell-off the car manufacturing business. Instead, he refused to give up and focused on making improvements to Indica based on customers\u2019 feedback.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the next few years, the car became a success and also a symbol of upward mobility for many middle-class Indians. Many years after this, Ratan Tata took up another audacious task of manufacturing the cheapest car in the world. His vision was to make sure that every Indian could afford a car that was available for only one lakh rupees. This is how Tata Nano was born. These stories show us his determination, strength of character and vision which speaks for the aspirations of Indians.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/greatspeculations\/2020\/12\/28\/ratan-tata-at-83-how-the-famed-chairman-transformed-the-128-year-old-indian-conglomerate\/\"><strong>Recent Death and Tributes<\/strong><\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the reason why the news of his passing away generated sorrow among many Indians who came on social media to express their views and admiration for Ratan Tata. Often referred to as the \u2018gentleman of Indian industry\u2019, he lived the life of a humble man which made him an idol for Indians who honour this quality dearly. While the outpouring of love and respect from the people continued, governments also came together to accord him a state funeral as his last rites were performed at the Worli crematorium in Mumbai. Several dignitaries, politicians, actors and business leaders attended the ceremony and paid their respects to the giant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tatacommunications.com\/articles\/journey-of-tata-group\/\"><strong>History of the Tatas<\/strong><\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tata \u2013 it is a name that almost every Indian must have heard. From the iconic Tata Salt advertisements of the 90s to the aspirational cars of 21<sup>st<\/sup> century, the house of Tata has touched numerous lives. The Tata Group was founded in 1868 by Jamsetji Tata, who is also known as the \u2018father of Indian industry\u2019. The business later became a global conglomerate and its success story runs parallel to the growth story of Independent India. Jamsetji\u2019s vision was not limited to just business success; he also emphasised nation-building and the betterment of society. Jamshedpur in Chhattirgarh is the only city named after a businessman in India. This speaks volumes of the impact that his work has had on India as a country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ratan Tata took over the reins of the Tata Group in 1991, a time when India was undergoing significant economic changes. Under his leadership, the Tata Group transformed from a traditional Indian company into a globally recognised brand. He was a visionary leader from the start and saw many acquisitions for the group like Tetley, Jaguar, etc. This propelled Tata as a brand on the global level. As also mentioned above, he showed a strong business sense, ability to take risks and innovation. This reflects in many projects that the Tata Group undertook under his vision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tatatrusts.org\/our-work\"><strong>Philanthropic Work<\/strong><\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing that sets Ratan Tata apart from many other businessmen is the amount of money he donated for the causes he believed in. A bachelor, he lived his life with dignity and humbleness, while it is believed that he donated around 40-50 per cent of his annual income for philanthropic and charity work. He was also the chairman of Tata Trusts, one of the biggest philanthropic organisations in India.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Ratan Tata&#8217;s significant philanthropic initiatives was the Tata Medical Center in Kolkata, a state-of-the-art cancer treatment and research facility. This center provides high-quality cancer care to people from all walks of life, ensuring that even the underprivileged have access to the best medical treatment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from this, he has also been an example for many when it comes to his personal acts of kindness and commitment. During the Mumbai Terror Attacks, he personally showed up outside the legendary Taj Hotel which is managed by Tata Group. He also had a deep love for stray dogs and other animals and donated a big amount to Parsi hospital in Mumbai to add world-class facilities for treatment of dogs. His dog Goa also lived with him till the last moments of Ratan Tata\u2019s life and came to Worli crematorium to bid goodbye to his master.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of Covid-19 crisis, Tata Trusts released substantial funds to support those in need, including efforts like providing medical equipment, helping frontline workers and aiding those affected by the pandemic. His willingness to help people in need, regardless of the circumstances, has endeared him to many and earned him immense respect. Perhaps this is the reason why a demand to bestow him with India\u2019s highest civilian honour \u2018Bharat Ratna\u2019 was renewed after his passing away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-india-37401302\"><strong>Lessons from Ratan Tata\u2019s Life<\/strong><\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While everyone can learn a lot from his life, the entrepreneurs and business leaders of today especially have a lot to take from the legacy of Mr Ratan Tata.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Integrity and ethics \u2013<\/strong> He always emphasised the importance of running a business with utmost integrity and adhering to the ethical principles. His belief was that the business should complement the growth of society and country, and not just grow in isolation.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Resilience and perseverance \u2013 <\/strong>With a decades long career as an industry leader who spearheaded some of the most innovative initiatives and reforms within the Tata Group, he is an example for today\u2019s entrepreneurs of how handwork and willingness to learn from one\u2019s mistakes can propel them forward.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Innovation and vision \u2013 <\/strong>As we saw in the examples of Tata Indica and Nano, he had a vision which was rooted in the reality of India. This is what set him apart. Tata group\u2019s takeover of Air India and its commitment to restore the airline to its past glory also speaks volumes of his vision.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Social responsibility \u2013<\/strong> Ratan Tata teaches every business leader that a life of simplicity and a life lived for helping others is not just desirable but also rewarding. His work as the chairman of Tata Trusts has impacted millions of lives. This is, perhaps, one of the biggest lessons for entrepreneurs today.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Humility and compassion \u2013 <\/strong>Reaching the top is not what makes an individual admirable. It is the connect with their roots and love for others in their heart which makes them a role model for many. This is what Ratan Tata\u2019s life teaches us all.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Ratan Tata&#8217;s legacy is woven with threads of innovation, integrity and altruism. His contributions to industry and society are monumental, and his impact will be felt for generations to come. As we look back at his life and his work, we must take back lessons in resilience, ethics, compassion and commitment. He will continue to be a guiding light for Indian entrepreneurs and his legacy will stay alive in the work that he has started.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ratan Tata is not just a name.
