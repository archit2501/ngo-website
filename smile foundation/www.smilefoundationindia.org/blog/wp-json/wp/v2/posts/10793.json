With the help of the group, she got access to microfinance and guidance to start her own tailoring business from home. She started her journey as the first woman entrepreneur from her village and, in turn, motivated many other women from her community to pursue independence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, Sunita became financially independent and also expanded her business as the demand grew. In the process, she employed two more women from her village who were also survivors of domestic abuse. The newfound financial independence and collective strength of women created a shift in societal attitudes, fostering respect and reducing instances of gender-based violence. The women acted as each other&#8217;s support and defended anyone who faced instances of violence or abuse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This example shows the power that women can hold when they are financially independent and running their own businesses. Not just that, they also empower other women in the process, become more aware and confident about their rights, and are able to band together and fight against the injustices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Gender-based Violence: A Global and Indian Perspective<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To an urban Indian, it may feel like gender-based violence is now a thing of the past. We do not see advertisements like \u2018<em>ghanti bajao campaign\u2019 <\/em>on television anymore asking people to intervene when they come across instances of domestic abuse in their neighbourhood. However, the problem is far from over. According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/news-room\/fact-sheets\/detail\/violence-against-women\">World Health Organization (WHO)<\/a>, approximately 1 in 3 women globally have experienced physical or sexual violence in their lifetime, most often by an intimate partner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In India, we saw a rather grim picture especially during the COVID-19 induced lockdown when an increase in the cases of domestic violence was reported. According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.isdm.org.in\/blog\/its-womens-day-but-on-ground-little-has-changed\">National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB)<\/a> data, there was a 12.9% increase in crimes against women between 2018 and 2022, with domestic violence, sexual assault, and harassment being the most common forms. Gender-based violence is not just about physical assault but it also acts as a way of restricting the women from achieving autonomy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has far-reaching consequences on women&#8217;s physical and mental <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/health\/\"   title=\"Health\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"1423\">health<\/a>, economic productivity, and social well-being. While there are strong legal frameworks in place to deal with this problem, many cases still go unreported or are solved at a local level to avoid any shame and embarrassment for the parties involved. The women who are victims of gender-based violence are also subjected to scrutiny from the society on various levels, making it even more difficult for them to speak up and take a stand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How More Women in Business Can Translate to Less Gender-based Violence<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where entrepreneurship among women can play a pivotal role. Here\u2019s how it can help in reducing gender-based violence:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Financial independence \u2013 <\/strong>As we saw above in the case of Sunita, financial independence gave her the opportunity to create a healthy life for herself and also help other women in the process. Being independent financially is the key to taking a stand for yourself when you are in trouble. When women are dependent on others financially, they also lack the power to stand up against mental or physical violence.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Challenging patriarchy \u2013 <\/strong>Women in business challenge traditional gender roles and stereotypes, fostering a culture of equality and respect. As women gain visibility and influence in the economic sphere, societal attitudes towards gender roles begin to shift.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Community progress \u2013 <\/strong>When women enter into businesses, they not only create a path for self-progress but also support other women in their community. At the same time, it has been observed that educated and independent women are also able to ensure better health and <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\"   title=\"Education\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2427\">education<\/a> for their children as well.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Creating role models \u2013 <\/strong>Successful women become strong role models in society and those women who are suffering from gender-based violence can turn to them in times of distress.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Workplace equality \u2013 <\/strong>Women in leadership positions are more likely to implement policies that address gender-based violence, such as anti-harassment measures and support systems for survivors. This creates safer and more inclusive workplaces.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from these, there are many other ways in which women in businesses can have a direct impact on reducing gender-based violence. For example, it was found in a <a href=\"https:\/\/ssir.org\/articles\/entry\/how_businesses_can_take_the_lead_in_combatting_gender_based_violence\">study in Uganda<\/a> that women who participated in economic empowerment programs experienced a 50% reduction in intimate partner violence. Similarly, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ifc.org\/content\/dam\/ifc\/doclink\/2023\/bfp-toolkit-for-action-gbv.pdf\">companies with women in leadership roles<\/a> have shown to adopt more inclusive and equitable workplace practices, contributing to a decline in workplace harassment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Bringing More Women into Businesses<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we understand the positive impact of women in businesses, the question is how we can ensure that more and more women have the opportunity to take this path. Here are some of the solutions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Access to finance \u2013 <\/strong>The most basic and also the most important aspect of starting a business is to have enough money for making an initial investment and setting up the business. While finance is easily accessible to people who already possess wealth, it may also be easier for men to get access to it because of the availability of collateral. Therefore, it is crucial that women are provided access to collateral-free loans, especially at subsidized interest rates, to enable them to take the risk and start a business.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Skill development \u2013<\/strong> Secondly, it is essential that women who have never had the chance to develop necessary skills to run a business are provided the support to learn this through capacity building workshops and peer support. Both government and non-government organizations have been working in this area in India.\u00a0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mentorship \u2013 <\/strong>Mentorship programs and networking opportunities can provide women with guidance, resources, and connections to succeed in business. Platforms like <a href=\"https:\/\/msme.gov.in\/women-entrepreneurs\">Udyam Sakhi and TiE Women<\/a> are fostering such ecosystems.\u00a0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Policy support \u2013 <\/strong>Another important step is to create policy interventions that support women entrepreneurs, especially those coming from lesser privileged backgrounds and regions. This way, more and more women will find the motivation to start their own businesses.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many other ways through which women can be encouraged to start businesses. These include awareness campaigns by the media, social change, and even creating a safe work environment for them. In the end, all these initiatives can come together to create an opportunity for women to become successful business owners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Smile\u2019s Work<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Smile Foundation&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/women-empowerment\/\">Swabhiman<\/a> initiative focuses on empowering underserved women through education, health, and livelihood programs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smile Foundation&#8217;s Swabhiman initiative is a comprehensive women&#8217;s empowerment program aimed at bringing pride and dignity to marginalized and socially excluded women and girls. Launched in 2005, Swabhiman, meaning &#8216;self-respect&#8217; in English, seeks to enable women to realize their self-esteem and optimum potential in every sphere of life through innovative community engagement strategies.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Components of the Swabhiman Initiative:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4 S Model:<\/strong> The program operates through a highly effective approach known as the &#8216;4 S Model,&#8217; which stands for:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Seeking Healthcare as a Behavior:<\/strong> Encouraging women to prioritize and seek necessary healthcare services.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Support through Education:<\/strong> Providing educational opportunities to empower women with knowledge and skills.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Support from Men through Male Involvement:<\/strong> Engaging men in the community to support women&#8217;s empowerment and challenge traditional gender roles.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sustaining Change in the Community:<\/strong> Ensuring long-term positive changes through community involvement and ownership.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Healthcare and Nutrition:<\/strong> The initiative focuses on maternal and child healthcare, menstrual health awareness, and nutrition enhancement. For instance, in Sangrur, community-based events called &#8216;godh-bharai&#8217; celebrate forthcoming motherhood, providing pregnant women with necessary information on birth preparedness, breastfeeding, and nutrition. citeturn0search6<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Development and Entrepreneurship:<\/strong> Swabhiman provides business skills training to capacitate women to start their own enterprises. This empowers them to become financially independent, improve their quality of life, and advocate for women&#8217;s rights, thereby creating sustainable and empowered communities.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Partnerships for Impact:<\/strong> Collaborations with organizations like Children&#8217;s International Foundation (CIF) address critical health, nutrition, education, and skill development needs for children and caregivers. This comprehensive approach impacts thousands, providing a holistic improvement in well-being and future opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Impact of the Swabhiman Initiative<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since its inception, Swabhiman has empowered over 150,000 women through various interventions. More than 1,000 women and adolescent girls trained as change agents are leading community initiatives and advocating for women&#8217;s rights. The initiative&#8217;s lifecycle approach ensures that education, healthcare, and <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/livelihood\/\"   title=\"Livelihood\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"603\">livelihood<\/a> opportunities reach the most vulnerable at every stage of their lives, fostering respect and reducing instances of gender-based violence.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The intersection of economic empowerment and gender equality offers a powerful pathway to address gender-based violence. By bringing more women into business, we can challenge the structural inequalities that perpetuate violence and create a society where women are respected and valued. While progress has been made, much work remains to be done to ensure that women have equal opportunities to thrive in the economic sphere.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sunita, a domestic violence survivor from a small village in Rajasthan, decided to take charge of her life and reached out to a local women\u2019s self-help group to seek their support.
