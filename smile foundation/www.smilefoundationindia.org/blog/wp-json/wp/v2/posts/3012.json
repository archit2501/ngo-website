His wife (Lakhi) passed away, when his only daughter, Pratima, was a few months old. With Pratima in his dear arms, Budhi knew he had to stay strong- for his daughter\u2019s sake. \u2018I have never been to school, but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t understand how powerful <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\"   title=\"Education\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"28\">education<\/a> is. I work hard every day to give my daughter a worthy life. I promised Lakhi that Pratima would not suffer because of poverty.\u2019 Budhi smiles and says, \u2018I think she\u2019s happy. She goes to school, she learns- teaches me also! I think I\u2019ll be able to do well by her<\/em>\u201d.<\/p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><p><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"636\" height=\"500\" style=\"font-size: revert;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Abdul.jpg\" alt=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: revert;\"> <\/span><em style=\"font-size: revert;\">Farhan is studies in Grade 4 at MAKZ School, our Mission Education centre in Mumbai- located in the slum cluster of Dharavi.

He shrugs, \u2018It was all worth it\u2019, he says. \u2018Fathers often say that they want their son to be like them, but I want him to be better- I want him to be great.\u2019 Abdul did every kind of job he could get his hands on, every job that got his hands dirty, just so that he could feed his family. \u2018If I get a chance- I would do it all over again. If it means my son can go to school and get the education that every child deserves, it\u2019s worth it!.<\/em>\u201d<\/p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"750\" height=\"558\" src=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Purna-chandu-1024x762.jpg\" alt=\"\"> <em>Ganesh studies in Grade 2 at Lepakshi, our Mission Education centre in Visakhapatnam.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><p>\u201c<em>He is the best son one could ever ask for. I mean, he has made a construction site his home! In today\u2019s time and age, what kid would do that willingly and happily?\u2019 asks Ganesh\u2019s father. Chandu is a construction worker- living without a place he could call home. But Ganesh never lets him feel that way. His mother is a domestic maid, and their overall family income is just about enough to feed the entire family once in a day. \u2018I and my wife work hard every day so that Ganesh never has a crease on his forehead. His happiness means the world to us. Every day, when we come tired from work, he always lights us up with his stories. Usually, it\u2019s the father who puts his son to sleep with bedtime stories, but in our case, Ganesh always lulls me to sleep with his.

I am very thankful to God. At least we have a home to sleep, food to eat, and children to love\u2019, says Ram Kumar. He works in a garbage dump, cleans drains and carries wastes from houses. \u2018My parents always taught me that no job is small if it is fulfilling your needs, and putting a smile on your family\u2019s faces\u2019. At times, \u2018my children get insulted by strangers because their father works in a dumpster. But I raised them with the same values as I was raised. They are my strong champions\u2019.
