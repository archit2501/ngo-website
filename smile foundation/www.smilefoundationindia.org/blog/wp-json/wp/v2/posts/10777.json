They have the capability to endure unique health challenges and display incredible resilience and strength. However, you must be wondering why we need to talk about the resilience of women\u2019s bodies? What is so unique about them? To begin with, women experience biological phenomena like menstruation and menopause, pregnancy and childbirth, and so much more which men don\u2019t go through. These experiences bring with them physical and psychological challenges that only women can understand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add to that the politics over women\u2019s bodies and the social expectations, and it becomes important for us to talk about this issue. There are countries around the world, many of them progressive nations, who restrict women\u2019s autonomy to take decisions like abortion. Then, culturally women\u2019s bodies are seen as something that needs to be protected or hidden, where the modesty and shame of a society lies. Politically, women\u2019s bodies have been treated like battlegrounds, often seen as trophies that the victor would take.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This shows that there is so much that needs to be talked about when it comes to women\u2019s bodies. However, we are going to restrict ourselves to the health and biological challenges that women face. Understanding and acknowledging the resilience of women&#8217;s bodies is crucial for creating policies and raising societal awareness that support women&#8217;s health and well-being.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Unique health challenges<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a recent report by the World Health Organization (WHO), more than a third of women experience lasting health problems after childbirth, highlighting the need for greater attention to women&#8217;s health issues. Let\u2019s look at the different challenges that women face:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Menstruation:<\/strong> Women experience menstruation starting from puberty (around the age of 12 or 13) and ending at menopause. This means that they experience this unique biological process for decades of their life. There are related issues like period pain, heavy bleeding, premenstrual syndrome, and others that can severely impact the physical and mental wellbeing of women and hamper their capability to perform daily activities. Further, there are issues like PCOS and other medical conditions that can increase the challenges faced by women.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pregnancy and childbirth: <\/strong>Nurturing a child for nine months is a period of immense emotional and physical transformation for women. At the same time, it can also pose several health risks. Complications such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and postpartum depression are common. The WHO report indicates that many women experience lasting health problems after childbirth, including chronic pain, incontinence, and mental health issues<strong>.<\/strong><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Menopause: <\/strong>This is marked by the end of reproductive years for women and is again accompanied by various emotional and physical changes. Women can experience night sweats, hot flashes, decreased bone density, and mood swings during this time. Menopause also increases the risk of certain health conditions, including cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This shows that women\u2019s bodies begin to experience significant changes starting from a young age of 12, and sometimes even lesser, and continue to experience these changes for decades. This is something women have to live with every day. Additionally, they have to face social taboos related to natural processes like menstruation. Further, women\u2019s bodies also have unique needs which need to be addressed to create an equitable environment for them in workplaces and public spaces. Like, the debate around period leaves is ongoing in India where it is being demanded that women be provided the opportunity to either work from home during the first day of the period or given an off day owing to the period pain and other discomforts that many women may experience during this time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there are issues related to pregnancy and the support women need. Consider the story of Meera, a mother of two from Mumbai. After experiencing a difficult delivery, Meera faced severe postpartum depression and chronic pain. With the support of her family and healthcare providers, she gradually regained her strength and resilience. She also got the necessary support from her workplace who allowed her to work from home after exhausting her maternity leave. This shows that understanding of women\u2019s challenges is crucial to make more empathetic decisions and build infrastructure which helps them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Women\u2019s bodies and societal awareness<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating societal awareness about women&#8217;s health issues is essential for promoting understanding, breaking stigmas, and advocating for better health policies. <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\"   title=\"Education\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2423\">Education<\/a>, media, and advocacy play pivotal roles in raising awareness and driving change. It is important that topics like menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause along with others are issues in detail at a young age with both girls and boys. These programs can help young people understand and appreciate the unique health challenges faced by women.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Media can also play a crucial role by rightly shaping public perception around these issues. This article is also an attempt in the same direction. By writing about these issues, creating content around them, and educating others, we can set the groundwork for larger policy and infrastructural changes that support women.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Policy implications and recommendations<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gender-sensitive healthcare:<\/strong> One of the biggest needs is to ensure that women from all walks of life have access to healthcare which understands and respects their unique requirements. This includes providing comprehensive reproductive health services, mental health support, and postnatal care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Workplace support:<\/strong> As discussed above, there needs to be more discussion around ways in which women can be supported and accommodated based on their unique challenges. This does not only benefit women but will go a long way in creating more empathy driven workplaces where employees are treated humanely and provided support whenever needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Access to resources: <\/strong>Ensuring access to essential health resources, such as menstrual hygiene products, prenatal and postnatal care, and mental health services, is crucial for promoting women&#8217;s health. Government and community programs can provide support to women in underserved areas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Smile&#8217;s Work<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Smile Foundation is dedicated to improving women\u2019s health, education, and financial independence through targeted programs that address healthcare access, gender equality, and <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/livelihood\/\"   title=\"Livelihood\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"601\">livelihood<\/a> opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/women-empowerment\/\">Swabhiman<\/a> Program<\/strong> \u2013 Since 2005, this initiative has empowered marginalized and socially excluded women by providing nutrition, healthcare services, and financial literacy training. By focusing on reproductive health, maternal care, and awareness programs, Swabhiman enables women to make informed decisions about their well-being.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/health\/\">Mobile Healthcare Services<\/a><\/strong> \u2013 Recognizing the barriers women face in accessing medical care, Smile Foundation operates mobile healthcare units that bring essential services\u2014including preventive check-ups, maternal care, and free medicines\u2014to underserved communities. In 2022-23 alone, over 75% of the 1+ million beneficiaries were women and children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/donate.smilefoundationindia.org\/donate-for-girl-child\">She Can Fly<\/a> <\/strong>Initiative \u2013 This program champions girl child education, nutrition, and self-confidence, ensuring that young girls have the tools they need to thrive. Each year, it supports 400,000+ girls and women, offering:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Education &amp; scholarships<\/strong><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Healthcare &amp; menstrual hygiene support<\/strong><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Job-oriented skill training<\/strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Advocacy &amp; awareness programs<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Smile Foundation\u2019s holistic approach is about building a society where women are empowered, educated, and supported at every stage of life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the issues that women face and how they continue to still perform as well as men in a society which is primarily designed for the latter shows their resilience and the resilience of their bodies. However, this does not mean that it is taken for granted and celebrated as a heroic act. Instead, what we need to do is to reduce the burden on women by spreading awareness about these unique challenges and creating a more accommodating social environment for them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we reflect on the remarkable resilience of women&#8217;s bodies, it is crucial to ask ourselves: How can we create a more supportive and understanding society for women? What policies and practices can we implement to ensure that women receive the care and support they need throughout their lives?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Women\u2019s bodies are remarkable.
