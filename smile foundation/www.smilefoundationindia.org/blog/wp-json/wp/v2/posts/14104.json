A recent Parliamentary report notes that only about 56.5% of government schools have electricity. This leaves nearly half of rural learners studying by daylight or kerosene lamp, cut off from the <strong>smart education <\/strong>the world now offers. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Government data show that barely 57% of schools even have computers and 54% have any Internet access. The result is inequality in urban and rural space. For example, in Delhi a vast majority of schools are digitally equipped, but in Bihar only 18.5% have Internet. In this setting, blending solar-powered infrastructure and digital classrooms can be a game-changer enabling round-the-clock electricity and internet even off the grid. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One Smile Foundation case study reports, in Odisha\u2019s remote Kalahandi district schools once lacking desks and often even teachers have been transformed under Digital India. Today they boast <strong>internet connectivity, smart boards, and e-learning platforms<\/strong>. Lessons that once felt abstract now come alive on screens. These quiet revolutions show how renewable-energy upgrades and EdTech can leapfrog rural schools over decades of neglect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solar classrooms are more than a modern convenience. They are vital green infrastructure for the future. A 2022 expert study of Madhya Pradesh\u2019s Harda district found that electrifying four rural schools and <em>anganwadis <\/em>with rooftop solar (and simple battery backups) boosted student attendance and enabled evening study sessions. Children could finally use smart classes, computers and the internet once there was light. Measured outcomes were impressive. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"724\" src=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Electricity-1024x724.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14222\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Electricity-1024x724.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Electricity-300x212.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Electricity-768x543.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Electricity-1536x1086.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Electricity-1200x848.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Electricity-1980x1400.jpg 1980w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Electricity.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Over a year the PV systems generated ~2,250 kWh of clean energy, saved \u20b918,000 in utility costs, cut carbon emissions by 47 tonnes (equivalent to planting 74 mature teak trees), and unlocked water-pumping for clean drinking water. In the words of the implementers, the quality of light from electricity, often LEDs, is much better and more efficient, directly improving learning conditions. Such results echo global evidence. UNESCO\u2019s new <strong>Green School Quality Standard<\/strong> explicitly calls for solar panels to provide a reliable energy source during electrical blackouts and drive climate action in schools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together, solar roofs and digital classrooms form a powerful green infrastructure  ecosystem. Solar panels on school roofs provide clean, off-grid power for ICT labs, water pumps, and safe lights. Classrooms become living labs where children literally plug into sustainability. Smile Foundation has facilitated solar panel installations in several partner education centres across nine states. These panels not only save energy costs, they are teaching tools with students learning first hand how renewable energy works and why it matters. The result is improved schooling today and a generation fluent in climate resilience. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As one Smile-backed <strong>Smart Classroom <\/strong>project found, solarisation plus tablets and interactive boards made learning interactive, engaging, and empowering in places long marked by deprivation. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"653\" src=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Screenshot-2025-07-25-151214-1024x653.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14105\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Screenshot-2025-07-25-151214-1024x653.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Screenshot-2025-07-25-151214-300x191.png 300w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Screenshot-2025-07-25-151214-768x490.png 768w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Screenshot-2025-07-25-151214-1536x979.png 1536w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Screenshot-2025-07-25-151214-1200x765.png 1200w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Screenshot-2025-07-25-151214.png 1545w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Critically, these green education initiatives align with India\u2019s development schemes and global goals. The Union Government\u2019s <em><strong>Samagra Shiksha<\/strong> <\/em>programme (the integrated school education scheme) now explicitly lets states use school electricity budgets to invest in solar\/hybrid systems to ensure sustainability. Likewise, flagship campaigns like <strong>Digital India<\/strong> and the National Education Policy 2020 call for 24\u00d77 schooling facilities and universal connectivity, which require steady power. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the global front, UNESCO\u2019s Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) agenda and the Greening Education Partnership stress climate-informed pedagogy and school infrastructure. UNESCO highlights that schools must walk the talk by greening learning environments. In fact, the UN\u2019s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development ties these threads neatly. SDG&nbsp;4 (quality education) and SDG&nbsp;7 (affordable clean energy) intersect in solar classrooms, while SDG&nbsp;13 (climate action) is advanced when students adopt renewable power. Smile Foundation\u2019s work is a microcosm of this synergy. Our projects are mapped to multiple SDGs, and indeed they now <strong>benefit 75,000+ students across 500+ schools<\/strong> in 9 states with these green-learning investments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Smile Foundation <\/strong>has long championed rural education and gender equity. In recent years, we have brought solar and digital tech to the fore. Our <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\">Mission Education<\/a><\/strong> centres now include <strong>Smart Classrooms<\/strong> equipped with projectors, tablets, and offline e-content \u2013 all powered by rooftop solar. This has <strong>enriched learning<\/strong> for thousands of underserved children. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in 2024 Smile and partners installed solar-powered digital classrooms in government schools across <strong>Assam, Meghalaya, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Haryana<\/strong>. These six states were chosen specifically for their high need of both electrification and digital access. By incorporating solar energy, the project emphasises sustainable practices within the educational sector while fostering an atmosphere conducive to 21st-century learning. Students no longer struggle with power cuts or mobile blackouts; instead, they use laptops and projectors every day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The outcomes are measurable and inspiring. Smile reports that its tech upgrades have directly impacted <strong>75,000 children<\/strong> <strong>in 2024<\/strong>, turning classrooms into hubs of climate action. Teachers now integrate interactive climate content into all subjects. Students at a Smile centre designed water rockets and roller coasters to learn physics, linking science to sustainability. Girls in these programmes are especially empowered. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier girls\u2019 education campaigns (<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/donation\/support-girl-child\">She Can Fly<\/a><\/strong>) and career fairs have built momentum, and now girls in rural classrooms actively engage with digital learning and STEM through Smile\u2019s OJT and STEM labs. Parents and community elders also notice a change. In places with solar classrooms, villagers report longer school hours, higher attendance, and a revived respect for education. Children who previously trudged home after noon now stay back for evening classes under electric lights, boosting study time and retention. In tribal Harda district, officials saw attendance rise immediately after panels went up with energy access driving higher enrolment and retention in school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quantitative gains are evident in learning metrics too. After technology interventions, tests scores and digital literacy jump. One study by Smile\u2019s team showed rural students exposed to tablets and e-lessons bridged about 60-70% of the learning gap compared to urban peers, particularly in maths and English. Computer education classes, once rare in small schools, are now routine. Perhaps most telling, Smile reports that anecdotally girls\u2019s participation in STEM doubled in schools with solar-powered labs (from 20% to over 45% of STEM club members). Young women on the solar-team become role models, saying if these panels can power our classroom, surely I can power my future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-25-at-14.17.02-1024x683.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14107\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-25-at-14.17.02-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-25-at-14.17.02-300x200.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-25-at-14.17.02-768x512.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-25-at-14.17.02-1200x800.jpeg 1200w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-25-at-14.17.02.jpeg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-policy-and-partnership-levers\"><strong>Policy and partnership levers<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>These on-the-ground results didn\u2019t happen by accident. We leveraged multiple policy and funding streams. Samagra Shiksha has earmarked funds for ICT labs and even suggests solar in the recurring budget. The <strong>Digital India<\/strong> and <strong>PM eVidya<\/strong> campaigns, launched during Covid, have built nationwide e-learning content (DIKSHA, SWAYAM, etc.) but their impact depends on power.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly, electrification and solar schemes must align with education budgets. Initiatives like <strong>Saubhagya<\/strong> (universal household electrification) and <strong>PM-KUSUM<\/strong> (solar pumps for farmers) exemplify the government\u2019s rural solar push; extending similar focus to schools is logical. In fact, MPs on the HRD Committee have urged a <strong>Green Schools Fund <\/strong>to install solar everywhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond government, corporate <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" title=\"Corporate Partnerships\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2626\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/corporate-partnership\/\">CSR<\/a> is a huge enabler. India\u2019s Companies Act mandates ~2% of profits go to CSR. Many corporations now target that money at education and sustainability. We have successfully partnered with firms to our education programme to fund tech labs and solar kits. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-climate-resilient-impact\"><strong>Climate-resilient impact<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Importantly, solarised schools promote more than literacy; they build climate resilience. Rural areas face increasing heatwaves and storms \u2013 governments and UNESCO urge adaptation in education. UNESCO\u2019s Green Schools framework even calls for flood-resistant classrooms and reliable off-grid power. Solar roofs, rainwater harvesting, and shade trees become part of green infrastructure on campus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Smile students plant native saplings and monitor their survival, they live SDG&nbsp;13 by converting learning spaces into <strong>green belts<\/strong> around school. One Smile tree-planting initiative in Maharashtra engaged 2,000 kids in planting 30,000 saplings \u2013 these not only sequester carbon but teach stewardship. Such projects forge a virtuous cycle: greener campuses reduce heat inside classrooms and lower energy needs. And with solar panels, a school\u2019s carbon footprint plummets \u2013 as the Harda case shows, just a few panels offset tens of tonnes of CO\u2082.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-the-data-shows\"><strong>What the data shows<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Multiple surveys underscore these benefits. The UDISE+ (national school census) data cited by Smile reveal that millions of Indian children lack access to even basic digital infrastructure. But recent upticks are promising. For example, Education For All in India\u2019s analysis of UDISE 2021\u201322 found that in some states like Uttar Pradesh solar adoption is rising (8.8% of schools had panels, up sharply in aided vs. govt schools), though many states still lag (e.g. only 3\u20134% in WB or Assam). This means huge potential remains untapped. Every percentage point of schools solarised could reach hundreds of thousands of students. Modeling studies show that increasing solar in schools directly correlates with improved learning outcomes. For instance, UDISE data cited in research suggest that schools with reliable lighting see 10\u201315% higher enrolment and exam pass rates compared to dark schools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another key metric is digital literacy. India\u2019s National ICT Literacy Index (2023) shows rural-urban gaps of 20 percentage points, with girls trailing boys by 10 points in connectivity. In Smile-supported villages, mobile-computer literacy camps have pushed up women\u2019s digital skills by ~30%. Anecdotally, girls in solar classrooms report newfound confidence: one 14-year-old girl from Jharkhand said, \u201cI can now use a laptop confidently to help my siblings with homework without fear of grid failure.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-scaling-up-with-policy-action\"><strong>Scaling up with policy action<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure every child benefits, we need smarter policy coordination:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Integrate Solar into All School Schemes:<\/strong> Samagra Shiksha and state education budgets should mandate solar kits as part of new school buildings and retrofits, just as they mandate toilets and ramps. States can issue dedicated guidelines (like the clause in Samagra allowing solar for sustainability). The Centre could create a <strong>Solar Schools<\/strong> component in national programmes, similar to how smart classrooms were funded.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Link Education and Energy Planning:<\/strong> Renewable-energy schemes (PM-KUSUM, rooftop solar missions) should explicitly include schools and <em>Anganwadis <\/em>as priority installations. For example, Rural Development funds or CSR solar pumps might co-finance schools\u2019 microgrids. Similarly, rural electrification efforts (e.g. Saubhagya or BharatNet connectivity) should be coordinated with Samagra districts, ensuring simultaneous rollout of power, net, and smart-boards.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Finance via CSR and Philanthropy:<\/strong> The government can incentivise greater CSR in this sector by recognising climate-and-education projects as doubly impactful. Tax breaks or matching grants could reward companies that fund solar-education collabs. Impact bonds and blended finance could also be used. For instance, a green bond for rural education infrastructure, with pay outs tied to metrics like enrolment or test scores.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cross-Sector Partnerships:<\/strong> NGOs, corporates, and local governments must co-design solutions. Smile\u2019s digital-cum-solar classroom in Haryana, done with state education officers\u2019 buy-in, is a model. National bodies (like the NITI Aayog\u2019s Atal Innovation Mission or the CSR Research Foundation) could convene task forces to replicate best practices across states. Teacher-training institutes should include modules on using solar\/ICT tools. Universities (like IITs) could donate expertise in low-cost solar tech for schools.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Promote Climate Education:<\/strong> The curriculum itself should reflect this infrastructure. If a school has solar panels, students should use them as teaching aids in math and science. Textbooks and online courses must highlight renewable tech projects happening locally. UNESCO\u2019s <strong>Education for Sustainable Development<\/strong> framework emphasises learning by doing \u2013 school solar projects are tailor-made for such pedagogy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-challenges-and-sustainability\"><strong>Challenges and sustainability<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, hurdles remain. Maintenance of solar kits, digital hardware, and connectivity can be tricky in remote areas. Govt schools often lack IT technicians, and panels require periodic cleaning. Here too, solutions exist. Solar vendors now often offer 5-year maintenance contracts. Rural youth clubs can be trained (perhaps under the \u201cSkill India\u201d umbrella) to service school systems, creating local jobs. Internet backhaul can piggyback on village panchayat networks or BharatNet. Importantly, communities must co-own these assets. Smile\u2019s model involves School Management Committees in each phase, ensuring parents and local leaders invest in upkeep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Financially, the long-term gains justify the costs. Solar installations have a 10\u201315 year payback from bill savings. Economic analyses show that every rupee invested in rural education yields ~\u20b94\u20135 in lifetime economic benefits from higher productivity. With green infrastructure, the environmental externalities (avoided pollution, climate resilience) stack on top. Thus multilateral agencies like the World Bank and ADB are increasingly funding \u201cgreen schools\u201d. India should tap such funds and align them with domestic CSR\/ADB projects (note ADB\u2019s own support for off-grid solar schools).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-equity-through-green-education\"><strong>Equity through green education<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 21st century, <strong>green infrastructure<\/strong> is as essential to education as desks and books. Solar-powered digital classrooms embody a perfect synergy. They deliver electricity, clean energy, and global knowledge to doorstep villages. By merging renewable energy and EdTech, India can ensure that being born in a far-flung panchayat no longer means a second-tier schooling. Instead, it can be a stepping stone in the <strong>Equitable, Sustainable Education<\/strong> envisioned by the SDGs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smile Foundation experience shows it\u2019s doable. Hundreds of schools across nine states, thousands of lives changed, and children inspired to be \u201ceco-warriors\u201d. Now, the task is to scale up rapidly through policy, partnerships, and funding. By embedding solar into every rural school and coupling it with quality digital content, India advances toward <em>Samagra Shiksha<\/em> for real \u2013 not just brick-and-mortar, but a full spectrum of facilities. This cross-sector approach \u2013 government norms, private CSR, civil-society innovation \u2013 can finally make electricity and internet as commonplace in rural India\u2019s classrooms as pencils and notebooks. In doing so, we do more than light up blackboards. We ignite young minds to become the <strong>green leaders<\/strong> India needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sources:<\/strong> Government and development reports on solar in schools; Smile Foundation\u2019s impact and project blogs; UNESCO guidelines and SDG frameworks; academic and expert analyses on rural education and energy.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In power-starved rural India, solar-powered classrooms are transforming how children learn.
