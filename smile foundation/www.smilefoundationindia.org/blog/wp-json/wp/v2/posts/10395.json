Within this framework, the<strong> <\/strong>Union Budget serves as a cornerstone for national cohesion, reflecting the government\u2019s unwavering commitment to holistic societal development. The Budget 2025 plays a pivotal role in strengthening the foundation of women empowerment initiatives, ensuring economic support, early childcare, and Anganwadi infrastructure. These targeted investments aim to provide women and their communities with the essential resources needed to lead healthy, stable, and prosperous lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Budget 2025: Women Empowerment Initiatives in Focus<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Union Budget is a strategic tool that shapes the nation\u2019s economic landscape, ensuring inclusive growth while upholding the government\u2019s responsibility to uplift minority groups. Budget 2025 carries forward this commitment, directing significant attention towards <a href=\"https:\/\/www.orfonline.org\/expert-speak\/budget-2025-26-and-women-s-empowerment-is-india-meeting-its-gender-goals\">bridging gender gaps and advancing women&#8217;s financial and social well-being.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Financial Empowerment of Women in India<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Budget 2025 underscores women&#8217;s financial inclusion, introducing initiatives that facilitate greater access to funding, business opportunities, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/why-india-should-invest-in-the-skill-development-of-youth\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">skill development<\/a>. Key provisions include<strong> <\/strong>increased financial support for women-led businesses, offering them a stronger foothold in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Notably, the 2025-26 gender budget introduces term loans up to INR 2 crore for first-time entrepreneurs, including women, over five years\u2014a move aimed at accelerating female entrepreneurship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Women\u2019s <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/health\/\"   title=\"Health\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"1408\">Health<\/a> is Non-Negotiable<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recognizing that women\u2019s health is the foundation of a thriving society, the government has prioritized healthcare accessibility and maternal well-being. The allocation for women\u2019s safety and security has seen a significant boost, reinforcing a safer environment for women across the country. The Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 schemes have received an increased allocation of INR 450.98 crore, ensuring improved nutrition and early childhood development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, despite these progressive measures, experts have raised concerns about persistent gaps in women\u2019s healthcare funding. The Matru Vandana Yojana, which provides INR 6000 per mother, has remained unchanged since 2013, failing to adjust for inflation, thereby reducing its impact. Additionally, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/how-can-we-improve-the-working-conditions-for-asha-and-anganwadi-workers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Anganwadi workers<\/a> continue to be underpaid, reflecting a chronic underfunding of maternal and child healthcare services. These gaps highlight the urgent need for targeted policy interventions and sustained investment in women\u2019s health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Equal <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\"   title=\"Education\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2406\">Education<\/a> for All with Budget 2025<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Education is a powerful catalyst for change, and Budget 2025 aims to<strong> <\/strong>bridge the gender <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/blended-learning-to-cross-over-the-digital-divide-in-education\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">digital divide through the National Mission on Education<\/a> through ICT, which has been allocated 100% funding for women. In a move to strengthen school infrastructure and learning quality, Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan\u2019s budget has increased to INR 12,375 crore, while the PM SHRI Schools scheme has received a significant boost to INR 2250 crore. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the government is promoting women\u2019s participation in STEM fields, ensuring that women have equal opportunities to excel in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. These investments reflect the government\u2019s unwavering commitment to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/increasing-women-representation-to-achieve-gender-equality\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">gender equality and fostering an ecosystem where women<\/a> can thrive in every domain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Budget 2025 Grants Special Status to Women- Why?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A gender-responsive approach is crucial to breaking down systemic barriers that have historically disadvantaged women. By addressing deep-rooted social norms, economic inequalities, and institutional biases, Budget 2025 aims to empower women to take control of their financial and social destinies. This involves advocating for a more equitable distribution of resources, fair labor market conditions, and holding governments and stakeholders accountable for their commitments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In India, the Union Budget is more than just a financial document\u2014it is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unwomen.org\/en\/digital-library\/publications\/2024\/10\/world-survey-on-the-role-of-women-in-development-2024\">a social protection tool for women<\/a>.

Being a social protection tool, the budget 2025 shall be able to benefit the maximum number of socially-economically challenged women of India, when social stakeholders and Corporate Social partnerships work hand in hand towards set goals.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thereby, it is pertinent to pause and align our corporate social responsibility goals towards <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/blog\/financial-inclusions-role-in-gender-equality\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">gender inclusivity in leadership roles<\/a>, participate in mentoring and investing women led businesses or encourage your organisation\u2019s business culture to help NGOs for women like Smile Foundation to empower urban poor, rural and tribal women of India with access to quality education, healthcare and financial development.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Collective Action with Social Stakeholders<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Smile Foundation, we recognize the transformative power of collaboration between corporate entities and NGOs in driving meaningful, sustainable change.
