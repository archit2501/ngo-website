Then, she and Sarabjot Singh secured a bronze medal in the 10m air pistol joint team event. Manu Bhaker became the first Indian shooter to win two medals at the Paris Olympics and the most successful Indian female shooter in history.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She and many women achievers in sports are setting examples and advocating for equality. In a country dealing with gender-based discrimination, these women are breaking male-dominated standards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Current Status of Girls in India<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Numerous girls are still unable to realise their full potential due to poverty and social inequalities. The Indian Constitution, legal system, and government policies all incorporate the principle of gender equality. Nevertheless, the truth of the status of women in several communities throughout India remains significantly different from these principles. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many girls and women are still limited by outdated social norms and practices that hinder their educational opportunities. However, investing in their <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education\/\"   title=\"Education\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"2255\">education<\/a> is important for the future of society. Moreover, for decades, the positive impact of sports on empowering young girls and women has been acknowledged.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Challenges Faced In The Journey To Empower Girls<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the challenges that girls encounter are directly linked to the economic, political, social and cultural disadvantages they deal with in their daily lives.&nbsp;Here are some:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Gender Inequality:<\/strong> Economic, political, social, and cultural disadvantages pose hazards to girls. Gender discrimination places girls at risk of child marriage, adolescent pregnancy, and violence. Gender inequality also comes in the form of poor <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/health\/\"   title=\"Health\" data-wpil-keyword-link=\"linked\"  data-wpil-monitor-id=\"1276\">health<\/a>, education, and exploitation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Lack of Safety:<\/strong> The safety of girls\u00a0in certain areas is of\u00a0utmost importance. Parents often express fear regarding the\u00a0distances their daughters have to go to\u00a0access education. Particularly in remote regions where there is a lack of both road infrastructure and dependable transport options<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Lack of Access to Education<\/strong>: Millions of females are denied access to education due to poverty, child marriage, and cultural norms.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Inadequate Health Facilities:<\/strong> In India, girls are often deprived of access to basic amenities, including healthcare services, sanitation and clean water. Girls drop out of school due to lack of separate toilets. Their physical health,\u00a0overall well-being and quality of life are adversely affected by the absence of these fundamental amenities.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Gender-based Violence:<\/strong> In India, girls are vulnerable to several\u00a0forms of abuse, such as physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. Girls are frequently subjected to substantial risks to their physical and psychological health, including domestic violence and sexual exploitation, which frequently result in severe and enduring repercussions.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Child Marriages:<\/strong> Child marriage perpetuates gender inequality and impedes the advancement of girls.\u00a0Despite a general decline, it remains\u00a0prevalent\u00a0in certain communities.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why we should empower girls?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Education guarantees that girls can&nbsp;learn and feel secure while in school, have the opportunity to complete education&nbsp;and acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in the labour market and take informed decisions in all spheres of life.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Education Empowers:<\/strong> The likelihood of females participating in decision-making processes within their families and communities is higher when they are educated. Empower girls to drive change in their nations and communities.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Reduces Poverty:<\/strong> Girls who receive an education are more likely to secure higher-paying employment, thereby contributing to their family&#8217;s income. Women with education are more likely to invest in their children&#8217;s education and well-being.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Better Health and Nutrition: <\/strong>Girls who are healthy are more likely to attend school consistently and achieve academic success. Education on health and hygiene enables females to make informed decisions regarding their health. In the long term, investing in the health of females results in a healthier population and a reduction in healthcare costs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Workforce Participation<\/strong>: Girls with\u00a0a formal education are more inclined to participate in the labour force,\u00a0making a valuable contribution to economic growth and promoting diversity. Women in the workforce contribute distinctive skills and perspectives that improve creativity and problem-solving in a variety of industries.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Economic Growth<\/strong>: It is essential to address the disparity in educational and job opportunities between genders, as doing so can have a significant positive impact on a nation&#8217;s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Allocating resources to the education and empowerment of girls leads to substantial economic benefits for society as a whole.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Sports as a Catalyst for Change<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The UN\u00a0Charter advocates\u00a0for the recognition of sport as a human right, with access that is unimpeded by any form of discrimination. Increasing the number of women in the administrative system, mentorship programmes, and coaching positions will facilitate the establishment of a more inclusive environment and establish a secure environment for women to engage in sports.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To empower girls and women\u00a0is the most effective method of levelling the playing field and helping tackle their challenges. We must enrol\u00a0them in schools, where they will learn, develop and transform their communities for the betterment of all.
