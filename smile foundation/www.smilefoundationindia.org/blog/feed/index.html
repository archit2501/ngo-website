<p>&#8220;Business has a responsibility beyond its basic responsibility to its shareholders; a responsibility to a broader constituency that includes its key stakeholders: customers, employees, NGOs, government &#8211; the people of the communities in which it operates.&#8221;</p>

<p>Corporate Social Responsibility in India has shifted from being viewed as an obligation to becoming a strategic enabler of sustainable growth. With Section 135 of the Companies Act making CSR mandatory, corporates now leverage purpose-driven NGO partnerships to achieve measurable outcomes. These collaborations embed ethics, innovation and accountability, fostering resilient communities and driving long-term societal transformation. In crux, one can understand the world of CSR through the <a href="https://jcsr.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40991-016-0004-6#:~:text=The%20four%2Dpart%20definitional%20framework%20for%20CSR,(Carroll%201979%2C%201991)." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Caroll’s pyramid of CSR </a>which defines responsibility across four layers- economic, legal, ethical and philanthropic.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeoJ2qX3KbYrJevJhXn81A7O7MbbWpn8Y6bgqaFLTd6ugDM8XdDhSgNoTLD6sARokM1ZSnuEiNNXGks7DmX-avsA5PoeFe3O-eJGrpL737ho0UZgps47D7iL4cwymbdTWL459Lj?key=RPmeM3Vvhk_I35cd56003g" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-csr-and-indian-businesses"><strong>CSR and Indian businesses</strong></h2>



<p>India’s business landscape experienced a transformation since 1990s. Industries expanded globally, driving impressive growth in sales and market share. Yet, alongside this progress came the realisation that unchecked expansion risked resource overuse and environmental strain. At the same time, as the bond between businesses and consumers deepened, it became clear that this relationship must also extend to supporting the communities that sustain them, thereby contributing to the holistic development of the nation.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Importance of CSR in India</strong></li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Globalisation</strong><br>Global trade and integrated supply chains have heightened expectations around fair labour practices, environmental stewardship and community welfare. Forward-looking companies now embrace CSR partnerships not only to comply with emerging regulations but also to build resilience, enhance market access and secure long-term growth.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>International guidelines</strong><br>Global frameworks such as the <a href="https://www.in.kpmg.com/pdf/csr_whitepaper.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">UN Global Compact and SA8000 </a>encourage corporates to align with universally accepted principles on human rights, the environment and anti-corruption. While advisory, these standards have significantly influenced CSR in India, motivating corporates to collaborate through CSR NGO partnerships that deliver practical, scalable solutions to social challenges.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Corporates as brands</strong><br>Corporates are no longer isolated economic actors but vital pillars of society. By embedding strategic CSR partnerships into their core, businesses in India are moving beyond traditional philanthropy to drive purposeful, lasting change. This alignment of profitability with social impact not only strengthens corporate reputation but also builds enduring trust with stakeholders.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcw9m8Ms01L-YojVaJjtTBK22sYktXKW72lzqdw9ytC2EWIPMMuxR8X6gbjFNkODytrD5qYAUviKT-xgbokJpt9iROCbdqz8EGpeivlSEn6u2mKGvfc2ZCX95bJEKDOK9vSSrPN?key=RPmeM3Vvhk_I35cd56003g" alt=""/></figure>



<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Strategic alignment with business goals </strong></li>
</ol>



<p>As per Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013 companies are supposed to allocate <strong>2% of average </strong>net profits towards social development. But, if one looks closely, the responsibility is not just monetarily, but in aligning CSR activities with broader business strategies. </p>



<p>Corporates through CSR partnerships establish a long term investment in sustainability. When companies integrate CSR laws into their core business models, they achieve a dual purpose of contributing to national development while also enforcing their own competitiveness. </p>



<p>For example, when a healthcare company invests in <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">rural healthcare initiatives</a> under CSR, they not only fulfils compliance but also builds trust within the communities, expands market reach and promotes a healthier customer base. </p>



<p>CSR is perceived as shared value creation, where profitability and social well being move hand in hand. It strengthens </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Brand reputation&nbsp;</strong></li>



<li><strong>Improves stakeholder trust</strong></li>



<li><strong>Enhances risk management&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Thereby, proving that structured CSR partnerships with NGOs enable effective last mile delivery and measurable impact.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcolSnIsgQygteE12CkmvpwVOgHM_vgZ6pDd3icaoJvlnRLnSdz3pJj48jVU8drBtuRaaOhnun3Ax2c5c0VsUjTG1IafgSotjjHZjNYPiA7r-ZsZo9MT41iB1dCARbUzWx6DoN9Bg?key=RPmeM3Vvhk_I35cd56003g" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Handbook on Corporate Social Responsibility in India (Source: PwC</strong>)</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-left"></p>



<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Community-centric approach </strong></li>
</ol>



<p><a href="https://www.pwc.in/assets/pdfs/publications/2013/handbook-on-corporate-social-responsibility-in-india.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"></a>One of the most critical shifts in Corporate Social Responsibility practice in India has been the movement from top-down philanthropy to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/02560909221094379" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">co-created community led models of development</a>.  According to the Journal of Business Perspective, 2022 research has shown that CSR initiatives designed with active community participation achieve greater relevance, sustainability and long term acceptance. </p>



<p>By involving local stakeholders in identifying challenges and shaping solutions, companies design interventions rooted in real needs and cultural contexts, making them more effective and sustainable. This participatory approach then fosters trust, ownership and stewardship, enabling communities to continue initiatives beyond the funding cycles. </p>



<p>On the other hand, NGOs in India play a vital role in bridging the gaps between the grassroot communities and corporates; by translating corporate intent into grassroots action through network and credibility. Thus showcasing that corporates, NGOs and communities can create purpose-driven partnerships that deliver inclusive scalability and ensure social change across India.</p>



<ol start="4" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Sustainability &amp; environmental responsibility &#8211; Focus areas</strong></li>
</ol>



<p><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/Strategy%20and%20Corporate%20Finance/Our%20Insights/Five%20ways%20that%20ESG%20creates%20value/Five-ways-that-ESG-creates-value.ashx" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">ESG driven CSR</a> demonstrates that companies integrating environmental, social and governance priorities enhance long term value creation rather than compromise it. Governance strengthens accountability, environmental projects deliver sustainability and the social dimension delivers the most immediate impact on the marginalised communities of India. By investing in the following focus areas, corporates can optimise their CSR goals with long term sustainability.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Education and skill development<br></strong>Education unlocks human potential and transforms communities. Initiatives that combine quality learning with vocational training equip children and youth to rise above poverty, secure dignified employment and contribute to society’s progress.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Healthcare and sanitation<br></strong>Accessible healthcare and sanitation protect both dignity and life. Mobile health units, preventive care and hygiene awareness bring critical services closer to underserved communities, ensuring healthier families and resilient futures.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Livelihood enhancement<br></strong>Sustainable livelihoods empower individuals with independence and dignity. Skill-building programmes and entrepreneurship opportunities create pathways out of poverty, enabling families to thrive and communities to achieve long-term social and economic stability.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Environmental sustainability<br></strong>Safeguarding the environment is central to future prosperity. Community-led conservation, water stewardship and sustainable practices inspire people to live in balance with nature, protecting resources for generations to come.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Women’s health and empowerment<br></strong>When women thrive, communities prosper. Focused interventions in nutrition, healthcare, education and skills give women the tools to lead healthier lives, access opportunities and uplift families and entire communities.</li>
</ul>



<ol start="5" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Scalability and innovation</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Smart CSR enabled by data and technology drives transparency and measurable outcomes. This systemic approach enables corporates to scale solutions, replicate success and address root causes of social challenges. By aligning innovation with impact, CSR in India is now evolving towards a future ready ecosystem delivering sustainable and verifiable results. </p>



<p>For example, tech-enabled CSR solutions are transforming impact delivery with AI enhancing education and healthcare while digital financial inclusion fosters equitable and sustainable growth</p>



<ol start="6" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Impact measurement and transparency</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Impact measurement in CSR is evolving through technology with AI enabling precise data collection, real time monitoring and transparent reporting. For business and communities, this integration ensures accountability, drives efficiency and scales sustainable solutions making technology-driven impact assessment integral to purpose led growth in India’s CSR landscape</p>



<ol start="7" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Emerging trends in CSR and CSR partnerships</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Corporate Social Responsibility in India has matured from philanthropy into a strategic tool for community transformation. To remain effective, corporates must align with emerging CSR trends that shape long-term impact:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Shift to strategic CSR partnerships</strong> – Moving beyond transactional funding towards long-term, systemic collaborations, strengthened by ESG–CSR convergence and transparent sustainability disclosures.<br></li>



<li><strong>Digital CSR</strong> – Leveraging e-learning, telehealth and digital skilling to expand reach and inclusion.<br></li>



<li><strong>Geographic expansion</strong> – Extending CSR initiatives into Tier 2/3 cities and rural communities for deeper social development.<br></li>



<li><strong>Thematic priorities</strong> – Health, women’s empowerment, STEM education, scholarships for girls and skill development as focus areas.<br></li>



<li><strong>Employee volunteering</strong> – Embedding purpose and ownership within corporate culture, amplifying community impact.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today’s discerning travellers are no longer influenced by luxury alone – they actively seek experiences rooted in purpose, sustainability and social responsibility. In response, the industry is turning to cause-related marketing (CRM) aligning brand identity with meaningful social impact. This marks the rise of impact-driven hospitality, where conscious consumption is reshaping how travel brands connect with their audiences.</p>



<p>With the global sustainable tourism market projected to grow to <a href="https://www.skyquestt.com/report/sustainable-tourism-market" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">USD 7.19 trillion by 2032</a>, CRM is fast becoming a key competitive differentiator. Brands that embed social purpose into their business model are earning greater relevance, and also deepening relationships with conscious consumers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-india-s-tourism-and-hospitality-landscape"><strong>India’s tourism and hospitality landscape</strong></h2>



<p>India’s tourism and hospitality sector is poised for <a href="https://www.ibef.org/industry/tourism-hospitality-india" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">exponential growth</a>, with expected revenues surpassing US$ 59 billion by 2038 and foreign tourist arrivals estimated to reach 30.5 million. Ministry of Tourism reports that the industry is growing at a 20% CAGR, fuelled primarily by an expanding middle-income demographic.</p>



<p>Indian consumers are gravitating towards travel experiences that mirror their values – whether through sustainable tourism, wellness retreats, experiential journeys, staycations, women-led travels, solo traveling or visits to offbeat destinations. It’s a chance for brands to shift from purely transactional relationships to becoming emotionally relevant in their customers’ lives.</p>



<p>Travel isn’t just about ticking off destinations anymore – it’s about meaning. By weaving cause-driven campaigns into today’s travel trends, brands have a chance to make every kind of trip a little more purposeful, and a whole lot more memorable.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-case-for-crm-in-indian-hospitality"><strong>The case for CRM in Indian hospitality</strong></h3>



<p>In a world where travellers are choosing meaning over mere miles, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10495142.2024.2329258#d1e180" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">cause-related marketing</a> gives brands a chance to stand for something bigger. For India’s travel and hospitality scene, infusing social purpose into the guest experience, when done authentically, can boost not just brand love, but real impact too. Think stronger connections, higher perceived value and a better brand fit with what today’s conscious travellers truly care about.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Build emotional equity</li>



<li>Inspire deeper consumer loyalty</li>



<li>Position themselves as purposeful industry leaders</li>



<li>Deliver value-driven hospitality experiences</li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-adoption-of-crm"><strong>Adoption of CRM</strong></h5>



<p>CRM fosters transparency and trust by linking business growth with social responsibility. It empowers brands to form long-term, emotionally anchored relationships with their audience.</p>



<p><strong>Example:</strong> A luxury hotel chain could launch a CRM campaign supporting <a class="wpil_keyword_link" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2654" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> for girls in tribal regions, where every booking contributes to a classroom seat-<br><em>“Your comfortable room gives her the chance to enter a classroom.”</em></p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-consumer-response"><strong><strong>Consumer Response</strong></strong></h5>



<p>When brands champion a cause, consumers are not only drawn to the brand, but also feel personally invested in the cause itself. This dual affinity enhances trust and positive brand sentiment.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Example: </strong>An airline partners with an NGO to plant a tree for every domestic booking, reinforcing its commitment to carbon offsetting and environmental stewardship.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-positive-brand-outcomes"><strong>Positive Brand Outcomes</strong></h5>



<p>CRM strengthens brand attitudes, boosts campaign participation, increases purchase intentions and builds brand loyalty, particularly among impact-oriented consumers. As per a survey of 637 consumers, it was observed that cause related marketing made a significant <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10495142.2024.2329258?utm_source=chatgpt.com" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">positive impact</a> on consumer brand engagement.</p>



<p><strong>Example: </strong>Hospitality brands offering welcome kits or hygiene essentials crafted by local women entrepreneurs can boost guest satisfaction, encourage social sharing, and create long-lasting brand advocates.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-consumer-brand-engagement"><strong>Consumer Brand Engagement</strong></h5>



<p>CRM stimulates deeper emotional, cognitive and behavioural engagement, encouraging customers to champion the brand beyond monetary transactions.</p>



<p><strong>Example:</strong> Brands can integrate their CRM through NGOs in India for rural immersion programmes where members engage with local artisans or <a class="wpil_keyword_link" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2651" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> workers to form a bond between customers, brand and the cause. </p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enhanced-consumer-perceived-value-nbsp"><strong>Enhanced Consumer Perceived Value&nbsp;</strong></h5>



<p>Consumer Perceived Value (CPV) is the perceived benefit from a product or service, beyond its functional utility – it includes emotional resonance, social contribution and brand purpose playing a role. When consumers see brands actively doing good, they perceive higher value in their purchase.</p>



<p><strong>Example: </strong>Hospitality brands can integrate menstrual hygiene workshops for adolescent girls in villages, aligning health and well being with their brand goals, giving guests a more meaningful stay.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd6Q8frPYfGvfx3BkLAVFchoYOUUvtkxF_POnuwC4iCNX6mIVaymsIzukxdBW2ljaxOKrG1r_0BNQZRQNTNEJcWAaSbLPWXpruNu0BrvhnuMD2EKMVmpbrwLR7UctAI9tQHm4h8og?key=fcIZhMAQAiLsvBg676ScRg" alt=""/></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-strategic-focus-areas-for-crm-driven-impact"><strong>Strategic focus areas for CRM-driven impact</strong></h3>



<p>The travel and hospitality industry uniquely engages consumers through direct, personal experiences. This proximity makes their relationship with both customers and local communities central to operations. By integrating cause-related marketing (CRM) focused on social issues relevant to their consumers&#8217; environments, brands can transform tourism into purpose-driven journeys creating lasting impact for communities while building meaningful brand value.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Education for economically deprived children </strong></li>
</ol>



<p>By aligning with CRM for education, hospitality and travel brands can support schooling for marginalised children of rural villages. This can showcase their commitment towards transforming leisure stays into life changing learning opportunities for young minds of India.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Women’s skilling and employment </strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Through CRM, brands can empower women in nearby communities by funding skill building in hospitality and travel industry enabling dignity, employment and generational change through every guest experience</p>



<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Enhance rural healthcare access</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Through CRM driven partnerships, brands can fund mobile healthcare units in remote or off beat destinations, building critical rural healthcare gaps while aligning brand presence with measurable social impact.</p>



<ol start="4" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Sustainability for everyone </strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Integrating CRM with sustainability in terms of nutritious local harvesting, brands can co-create kitchen gardens, nurturing both community health and a brand narrative rooted in good health for the underserved communities of India.&nbsp;</p>

While policies and progress sound great on paper, the reality on the ground tells a different story — one where access to healthcare, financial tools and basic opportunities is still a daily struggle. But there’s hope. Through government schemes and Smile Foundation’s Swabhiman programme, women are getting the support they need to lead fuller, healthier lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a rapidly advancing economy, one critical question demands attention: where do rural Indian women stand today? With nearly 48% of women still residing in rural areas, their progress remains central to the nation’s broader development. As technology and financial reforms reshape India’s economic landscape, the concern persists — are rural women advancing alongside the rest of the country, or are they being left behind?</p>



<p>India has made notable jump through legal reforms, government schemes, corporate collaborations and grassroots NGO efforts that aim to empower women. These initiatives have contributed to safer, more supportive environments for rural women. However, substantial challenges remain. Many rural areas continue to lack the infrastructure, resources and opportunities necessary for inclusive and equitable growth. Among the most urgent concerns are persistent <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2657" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> vulnerabilities and financial exclusion, both of which hinder the full participation of rural women in India&#8217;s development journey.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-her-health-vulnerabilities"><strong>Her Health Vulnerabilities</strong></h2>



<p>Women in rural India face ongoing health challenges, especially in maternal and reproductive care. Limited access to quality healthcare, preventive screenings and proper nutrition compounds their vulnerability. In Jharkhand, for instance, the Food, Nutrition, Health and WASH programme mobilised <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/health-hygiene-prog-expands-to-263-blocks/articleshow/122865171.cms" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">3.2 million women</a> through self-help groups (SHGs) to promote hygiene and health underscoring the scale of unmet need.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S187758452400011X" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5)</a> reports that over 57% of rural women aged 15–49 are anaemic, revealing a serious public health burden. Maternal mortality remains a critical issue, with India recording a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) of 97 per 100,000 live births (2018–2020), disproportionately affecting rural regions. At the same time, the rise of non-communicable diseases such as hypertension and diabetes poses growing risks to the long-term well-being of women.</p>



<p>Without adequate protection mechanisms, women often delay seeking care due to cost, distance or lack of awareness. This leads to preventable health shocks and higher maternal mortality, further weakening household resilience and relegating women&#8217;s health needs to secondary status.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-her-financial-vulnerabilities"><strong>Her Financial Vulnerabilities</strong></h2>



<p>Despite the growth of entrepreneurship initiatives targeting rural women, financial exclusion continues to undermine their economic agency. According to a 2023 NITI Aayog report, just 14% of Indian women are engaged in entrepreneurial activity, with even fewer represented in the formal sector. Structural barriers persist, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Limited access to institutional credit</li>



<li>Inadequate digital infrastructure</li>



<li>Absence of gender-responsive support systems</li>



<li>Social norms that limit decision-making and ownership</li>
</ul>



<p>While women now hold <a href="https://bfsi.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/banking/women-own-39-2-of-bank-accounts-in-india-42-2-in-rural-areas-government-report/120057614" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">42.2% of rural bank accounts</a>, they still face difficulties accessing credit, savings products and digital financial tools. Encouragingly, the number of women borrowers has tripled since 2019, with 60% from rural and semi-urban areas. (<em>From Borrowers to Builders: Women’s Role in India’s Financial Growth Story</em>)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-systemic-barriers-hindering-her-overall-growth"><strong>Systemic barriers hindering her overall growth</strong></h2>



<p>Beyond financial and health-related challenges, rural women face systemic barriers at the institutional and community levels, where adequate support is often lacking.</p>



<p>Cumbersome, bureaucratic loan processes laden with documentation and procedural delays discourage many from pursuing opportunities.<br>The absence of structured mentorship and peer support leaves aspiring entrepreneurs without networks to scale and sustain their businesses.<br>Gender bias and entrenched stereotypes within financial institutions and community settings continue to question women&#8217;s credibility and leadership potential.</p>



<p>Overcoming these barriers is essential to realising the full potential of rural women. The way forward must involve making social protection accessible to every woman, particularly those in India’s most remote and underserved regions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-social-protection-for-women-of-rural-communities"><strong>Understanding social protection for women of rural communities </strong></h3>



<p>To meaningfully include rural women under the social protection umbrella, we must begin with a clear definition. The International Labour Organisation defines social protection as the <a href="https://www.ilo.org/topics-and-sectors/social-protection" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">provision of social security</a> in response to life risks such as unemployment, disability and maternity as well as support for those experiencing poverty or social exclusion.</p>



<p>This definition reveals that poverty and exclusion disproportionately impact women in rural areas. Globally, over two billion women and girls lack access to any form of social protection. In India, this gap is equally concerning. Even where social protection mechanisms are in place, gender disparities persist. According to UN data, <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2024/10/world-survey-on-the-role-of-women-in-development-2024" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">only 50.1% of women</a> access at least one social protection benefit compared to 54.6% of men. Rural women face the highest levels of exclusion.</p>



<p>These figures highlight the urgency of developing a robust, gender-responsive social protection framework — one that not only extends coverage but also propels rural women forward in their journey toward empowerment and economic inclusion.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-government-initiatives-supporting-rural-women"><strong>Government initiatives supporting rural women</strong></h3>



<p>To advance women’s empowerment across rural India, the government has implemented several strategic programmes. Some of the most impactful include:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM)</strong><br>NRLM strengthens women’s self-help groups, expands credit access and promotes entrepreneurship building sustainable livelihoods and community resilience.</li>



<li><strong>MGNREGA</strong><br>With one-third of its jobs reserved for women, MGNREGA ensures fair wages, income security and economic independence.</li>



<li><strong>e-NAM and Cooperatives (NCDC)</strong><br>By facilitating market linkages and collective bargaining, women gain access to fair pricing and new opportunities in agriculture, dairy and textiles.</li>



<li><strong>Mission Poshan 2.0 and PMMVY</strong><br>These initiatives promote maternal nutrition and provide direct cash transfers, addressing critical vulnerabilities during pregnancy and early motherhood.</li>



<li><strong>Swachh Bharat, Ujjwala, and Jal Jeevan Missions</strong><br>Access to sanitation, clean water, and LPG connections improves health outcomes, reduces domestic drudgery and frees up time for <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2656" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> and employment.</li>



<li><strong>Digital Literacy and Mission Shakti</strong><br>Through digital training and safety initiatives, these programmes enhance women’s access to information, services and institutional support.</li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-swabhiman-a-grassroots-pillar-of-social-protection"><strong>Swabhiman – A grassroots pillar of social protection</strong></h3>



<p>While government policies set the groundwork, the true test of social protection lies in last-mile delivery ensuring access to health, nutrition and financial tools at the doorstep. Smile Foundation&#8217;s <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/women-empowerment/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Swabhiman</a></strong> programme plays a vital role in bridging this delivery gap, offering targeted support to rural women across multiple dimensions of empowerment.</p>



<p>In FY 2024, Swabhiman reached over 190,000 women across six states, equipping them with access to healthcare, financial literacy and entrepreneurial skills. The programme recognises that sustainable workforce participation is intricately tied to health, dignity and opportunity.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-partnering-for-women-s-empowerment-and-social-protection"><strong>Partnering for women’s empowerment and social protection</strong></h4>



<p>Rural women in India are resilient and ready to lead. Yet their advancement depends on equitable systems — ones that guarantee access to health services, financial resources and sustained opportunities.</p>



<p>Smile Foundation’s Swabhiman initiative provides a credible platform for corporates and civil society to partner with government efforts. By integrating healthcare, vocational training and financial and digital literacy, Swabhiman helps build long-term, community-rooted pathways for empowerment.</p>



<p>Together, we can ensure that social protection reaches the last mile and that every woman, no matter where she lives, has the opportunity to thrive.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you grew up in northern India, chances are you’ve heard the saying <em>Padhoge Likhoge Banoge Nawab </em>(study hard and you’ll go far in life). It’s one of those timeless proverbs that families pass down, a reminder of how deeply education is valued in our culture. The phrase became even more popular after Asha Bhosale sang it in the 1958 film <em><strong>Malik</strong></em>. Back then, just a decade after independence, this wasn’t just a catchy line – it echoed a national belief that <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2650" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> ( a means for good employability) wasn’t just good for the individual, it was essential for building the future of the country.</p>



<p>In a newly sovereign India grappling with poverty, illiteracy, and social fragmentation, this proverb encapsulated a powerful aspiration. It signified hope for millions, who saw education as the primary vehicle for socioeconomic transformation. The imagery of the nawab as in the phrase was not literal but symbolic – it represented dignity, status and participation in the democratic promise of postcolonial India. The assumption was that an educated populace would serve as the vanguard of progress and modernity.</p>



<p>But today, that hopeful vision needs a closer look. Sure, more kids are in school than ever before, but just getting an education isn’t always enough. The big question now is: are we preparing young people for real jobs and real opportunities? For many, the link between schooling and a meaningful livelihood still feels weak. It’s time to rethink what we’re teaching, how we’re teaching it, and whether it’s truly setting students up for success.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-addressing-the-massive-gap"><strong>Addressing the massive gap</strong></h2>



<p>Here’s the tough reality: in India today, getting a degree doesn’t always lead to a job. In fact, more education can sometimes mean fewer chances at employment. Sounds backwards, but the numbers say it all. According to Azim Premji University’s <a href="https://azimpremjiuniversity.edu.in/the-indian-economy/state-of-working-india-2023" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><em>State of Working India 2023</em> </a>report, nearly <strong>43% of graduates under 25</strong> are unemployed. That’s twice the rate of those who stopped at secondary school. Some states are seeing this gap even more sharply with Andhra Pradesh having more than 35% of graduates jobless in late 2022. Even more telling is that the graduates made up a whopping 73% of the state’s total unemployed. It’s a worrying sign that our education system isn’t connecting with the job market, and young people are paying the price.</p>



<p>You can really see this disconnect playing out in real life. In Uttar Pradesh, government job openings for low-skill roles, like messengers or railway porters, which need only a 5th or 10th-grade education recently saw <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/railways-jobs-jobs-in-railways-indian-railways-had-63-000-job-openings-19-million-people-applied-1974696" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">hundreds of thousands of applicants</a>. But the catch is many of them were postgraduates, MBAs, even PhDs. When highly educated people line up for jobs that don’t need those qualifications, it’s a clear sign that something’s broken. The deeper issue is whether our education system is preparing people for the kind of work that actually exists or not.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-recognising-impediments-in-the-process-of-employability"><strong>Recognising impediments in the process of employability </strong></h2>



<p>According to the <strong><a href="https://resources.mettl.com/research/india-graduate-skill-index-2025/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Mercer-Mettl Graduate Skill Index 2025</a></strong>, only 42.6% of Indian graduates are considered employable, down from 44.3% in 2023. It&#8217;s a worrying trend that reflects a growing disconnect between education and what the job market actually needs.</p>



<p>A big part of the problem is the way many universities still operate. Rote learning and outdated syllabi leave little room for building relevant skills. Students rarely get to work with technologies that are reshaping the world of work like artificial intelligence, data analytics, cloud computing or cybersecurity. They earn degrees, but not necessarily the capabilities that help them thrive at work.</p>



<p>Practical experience is often missing too. Internships, live projects and apprenticeships are still not mainstream in higher education. This means graduates often step into the workforce without ever having worked in a real-world setting. On top of that, soft skills like communication, critical thinking and teamwork don’t get the attention they deserve.</p>



<p>The employability gap widens further when you consider regional disparities, gender gaps and the slow rate of job creation. For many young people, especially in underserved areas, it’s about access and opportunity.</p>



<p>To change this, we need much closer collaboration between industry and academia. Course design should involve employers. Students need hands-on learning built into their programmes. And soft skills training should be as essential as technical knowledge. We also need to explore new approaches that respond to fast-changing market needs and help young people build their own paths – whether that’s in jobs or entrepreneurship.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-real-world-solutions-for-more-employability-in-india"><strong>Building real world solutions</strong> <strong>for more employability in India</strong></h2>



<p>The growing gap between college degrees and job readiness can’t be ignored. While government-led skilling schemes and education reforms are an important part of the solution, they aren’t enough on their own. What’s needed is a more collaborative approach, one that brings in civil society, NGOs and community-based organisations that work directly with young people, especially those from underserved backgrounds.</p>



<p>Take Smile Foundation’s <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">STeP (Smile Twin e-Learning Programme)</a>, for example. It’s designed to equip young people with both the technical and soft skills they need to get into the workforce. Beyond training, STeP also offers career counselling to help participants make informed, realistic choices about their future.</p>



<p>Between 2023 and 2024, over 9,000 young people were trained through the STeP programme. Of these, 550 went on to secure jobs across a range of industries. We also conducted more than 800 career counselling sessions and organised multiple industry exposure visits, giving participants a real sense of what different workplaces are like.</p>



<p>Support doesn’t end once someone completes the training or gets placed. STeP offers continued guidance – from confidence-building and interview prep to post-placement support so that young people feel equipped to stay and grow in the jobs they land.</p>



<p>Initiatives like this show that employability is also about helping young people build aspirations, understand their options and connect to opportunities that often lie just out of reach.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>In India, crimes against women remain alarmingly high ranging from domestic violence and dowry deaths to acid attacks and sexual assault. Over 29% of women report intimate partner violence, while around 7,000 dowry-related deaths occur annually. These numbers reflect deep-rooted inequalities. Smile Foundation is working at the grassroots to empower women and girls through education, health, and leadership training.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Crimes against women – ranging from domestic abuse to sexual assault – are a pervasive global issue. The World Health Organization estimates that at least one in three women worldwide has experienced physical or sexual violence in her lifetime. In India, entrenched patriarchal norms and economic dependency often compound the problem. Official data show disturbing trends: the 2022 NCRB report recorded <strong>66.4 crimes per 100,000 women</strong>, up from 58.8 in 2018 (a 12.9% increase). Most reported cases are domestic (31.4% involve cruelty by husbands or relatives) or sexual (7.1% are rape cases). </p>



<p>Even workplace harassment is rising. Complaints under the POSH Act grew from 402 in 2018 to 422 in 2022. Globally too the toll is high – in 2022 about 89,000 women and girls were victims of intentional homicide – and South Asia bears a heavy burden. India, ranked <strong>128th out of 177 countries on women’s security in 2023</strong>, continues to see heinous crimes despite legal reforms.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="825" height="519" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/violence-against-women-increase.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14205" style="width:394px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/violence-against-women-increase.jpg 825w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/violence-against-women-increase-300x189.jpg 300w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/violence-against-women-increase-768x483.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></figure>



<p><em><strong>Chart: </strong></em>Reported crimes against women in India climbed from 58.8 to 66.4 per 100,000 women between 2018 and 2022 (NCRB data). This 12.9% rise highlights growing violence and/or better reporting.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-forms-of-violence-against-women"><strong>Forms of violence against women</strong></h2>



<p>Crimes against women take many forms, all rooted in gender inequality. Major categories include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Domestic violence</strong> – Physical, emotional or sexual abuse by a husband or family member (cruelty under IPC §498A). This is the most common crime: about 31.4% of all reported violence against women in India is “cruelty by husband/relatives”. Such abuse can range from beatings and intimidation to coerced suicide.</li>



<li><strong>Sexual assault and harassment</strong> – Non-consensual acts like <strong>rape</strong>, molestation and sexual abuse. Rape accounted for 7.1% of crimes against women in 2022, though experts note under-reporting. Outraging a woman’s modesty (molestation) was 18.7% of cases. At the workplace or in public spaces, harassment (now punishable under the 2013 <em>POSH Act</em>) is also widespread.</li>



<li><strong>Dowry Harassment and Death</strong> – Demands for dowry often lead to cruelty and even murder. Despite legal bans, thousands of cases are reported annually. In 2020 India logged about 10,366 dowry harassment cases and 6,966 dowry deaths. Victims may face torture or death when in-laws demand more gifts or money.</li>



<li><strong>Trafficking and exploitation</strong> – Women and girls are trafficked for sexual or labour exploitation. This includes prostitution and bonded labour (IPC 370–372). Many young women are lured or kidnapped into a network of abuse. Under special laws, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11288248/#:~:text=%2817%29,Information%20on%20female" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">immoral trafficking</a> and buying/selling of minor girls are recognised offences.</li>



<li><strong>Child marriage and child abuse</strong> – Forced underage marriage and sexual exploitation of minors violates the law (Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, POCSO Act). Adolescent girls are especially vulnerable to rape and forced marriage, which carry their own penalties. Child marriage is officially banned, but enforcement gaps persist.</li>



<li><strong>Honour killings and witch-hunting</strong> – In some regions, women are murdered by relatives for perceived &#8216;honour&#8217; violations (e.g., marrying outside caste) or accused of witchcraft. These extrajudicial crimes are rooted in superstition and patriarchy. The government has special provisions, but cases still surface in tribal and rural areas.</li>



<li><strong>Acid attacks</strong> – Deliberate pouring of acid (often by rejected suitors or relatives) to disfigure women. Since 2013 acid attacks are a distinct crime (IPC 326A) punishable by <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2016/3/10/indian-acid-attack-victims-share-their-stories#:~:text=Effective%20from%20February%202013%2C%20with,and%20a%20maximum%20of%20life" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">10 years to life imprisonment</a>. However, cases have risen. Media reports cite hundreds of attacks a year. Acid violence is most common in South Asia; Bangladesh’s strict laws have reduced attacks by ~20–30%, but India continues to see many incidents.</li>



<li><strong>Cyber and online abuse</strong> – Digital stalking, harassment, non-consensual sharing of images (&#8216;revenge porn&#8217;), and bullying of women online. This emerging threat is covered under IT laws, but enforcement is still developing. A recent NCRB category &#8216;cybercrime against women&#8217; reflects this growing trend.</li>
</ul>



<p>These forms often overlap and compound one another. For example, a woman facing dowry torture may also be raped or threatened with acid. Children can be victims of sexual abuse at home or trafficked. In India, the United Nations notes that gender-based violence includes all these facets – domestic abuse, dowry violence, honor crimes, acid attacks and more. Each form leaves deep scars on survivors and families.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-impact-of-violence"><strong>Impact of violence</strong></h2>



<p>The consequences of crimes against women are devastating on multiple levels. Physically, victims suffer injuries, chronic pain, disabilities or unwanted pregnancies. Psychologically, they face trauma, depression, stigma and loss of trust. Many survivors struggle with social isolation and economic hardship, as abuse often destroys livelihoods. </p>



<p>According to public <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2646" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> experts, these individual impacts add up. Violence increases women’s health problems, can lead to STIs or death, and even disrupts entire families. At a societal level, gender-based violence violates basic human rights and undermines development goals. It reduces women’s participation in <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2647" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> and the workforce, cutting productivity. UN reports warn that such violence hinders progress on Sustainable Development Goals (like good health, equality, and decent work).</p>



<p>In India, these impacts are compounded by social and economic factors. Many women lack financial independence or legal awareness, making it hard to escape abusive situations. For instance, under many custom and inheritance norms women cannot claim property, and most work in informal jobs without protection. </p>



<p>The National Family Health Survey (2019–21) found <strong>29.3% of women aged 18–49</strong> have experienced spousal violence in their lifetime. Even if crimes are reported, justice can be slow; patriarchal attitudes often blame victims or discourage their testimony. As a result, many cases never enter the official record at all. Experts note that cultural shame and fear of retaliation are huge barriers to reporting.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WOMEN-EMPOWERMENT-IN-INDIA-Initiatives-Driving-Chang-Change-2-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14209" style="width:366px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WOMEN-EMPOWERMENT-IN-INDIA-Initiatives-Driving-Chang-Change-2-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WOMEN-EMPOWERMENT-IN-INDIA-Initiatives-Driving-Chang-Change-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WOMEN-EMPOWERMENT-IN-INDIA-Initiatives-Driving-Chang-Change-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WOMEN-EMPOWERMENT-IN-INDIA-Initiatives-Driving-Chang-Change-2.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></figure>



<p>Real stories illustrate these hardships. <strong><a href="https://www.gicj.org/lest-we-forget/2874-laxmi-agarwal-the-acid-attack-survivor#:~:text=Laxmi%20Agarwal%20was%2015%20years,1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Laxmi Agarwal</a></strong>, for example, was just 15 when a jilted man threw acid on her. She spent years in surgery and faced social stigma, even as she tirelessly campaigned for stricter acid laws. Her efforts (and similar ones by activists) led the Supreme Court in 2013 to impose tighter controls on acid sales and higher compensation for survivors. Today Laxmi heads a foundation that helps fellow survivors rebuild their lives. Her courage shows how victims can become voices for change but it also underscores the brutality of these crimes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-legal-protections-and-government-schemes"><strong>Legal protections and government schemes</strong></h2>



<p>India has a broad legal framework to address violence against women. Key laws include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>IPC 498A</strong> (Cruelty by husband/relatives) – Penalises physical or mental cruelty to women in marriage, including dowry demands.</li>



<li><strong>Protection of women from Domestic Violence Act (2005)</strong> – Allows survivors to seek protection orders, residence rights, and maintenance from abusive partners.</li>



<li><strong>IPC 304B</strong> (Dowry Death) – Punishes death of a bride within 7 years of marriage if dowry harassment is proven.</li>



<li><strong>Dowry Prohibition Act (1961)</strong> – Bans requesting or giving dowry gifts; harassment under this Act saw over 13,000 cases in 2019.</li>



<li><strong>POCSO Act (2012)</strong> – Protects children (including girl children) from sexual offences with stringent penalties.</li>



<li><strong>Criminal Law (Amendment) Acts (2013, 2018)</strong> – Enacted after high-profile cases, these strengthened rape laws (including fast-track courts, death penalty for gang-rape), and clarified offenses like stalking and acid attacks.</li>



<li><strong>Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act (2013)</strong> – Mandates employers to prevent and address sexual harassment on the job (though social awareness and complaint rates remain low).</li>
</ul>



<p>Beyond laws, the government runs many schemes and support systems. For victims of violence, <strong>One Stop Centres</strong> (also called <em>Sakhi </em>Centres) were launched in 2015 to provide integrated aid. These centers offer medical care, legal counselling, police liaison, and temporary shelter under one roof for survivors of domestic or public violence. The Ministry of Women &amp; Child Development reports over 708 One Stop Centres were operational by 2022, assisting 540,000 women nationwide.</p>



<p>Other initiatives include a 24×7 Women’s Helpline (1091/181) and the unified emergency number 112 for immediate assistance; <em><strong>Beti Bachao Beti Padhao</strong> </em>campaign to promote girl child welfare; <strong>Safe City Projects</strong> (in major cities) installing CCTV and better lighting; and <strong>Mahila Adalats</strong> (special women’s courts) for resolving complaints quickly. Police stations also now have <strong>Women’s Help Desks</strong> for gender-sensitive handling of cases. </p>



<p>Funds from the <strong>Nirbhaya Fund</strong> are used for training investigators, setting up trauma rooms, and providing forensic kits to speed up rape case trials. The National Commission for Women (NCW) itself operates a dedicated WhatsApp helpline (72177-35372) to report violence. All these measures aim to plug gaps in the system.</p>



<p>Despite the laws, enforcement is uneven. Experts urge further action. Educational campaigns in schools, community-level gender-sensitisation, and better funding for support services. For example, the Women’s Commission notes that combining legal aid with job training and counselling is crucial to help survivors rebuild independent lives. In other words, legal remedies must go hand-in-hand with social change to truly curb these crimes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crimes-against-women-india-vs-global-context"><strong>Crimes against women: India vs. Global context</strong></h2>



<p>While violence against women is universal, its shape and prevalence vary by region. Globally, WHO data indicate that about 30% of women experience intimate partner or sexual violence in their lives. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reported nearly 89,000 gender-related homicides of women/girls worldwide in 2022. South Asia bears a disproportionate share of certain crimes. </p>



<p><strong>For example, India – like neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh – has historically high rates of acid attacks and honour killings. Notably, Bangladesh’s strict acid laws have led to a 20–30% decline in attacks, a success India still strives for.</strong></p>



<p>India’s Women Peace and Security Index rank (128/177 in 2023) trails most developed countries. Factors include continuing social inequality, access to justice, and political representation. In some metrics India outperforms its neighbours. According to the 2021 National Family Health Survey, the child sex ratio (females per 1000 males) improved to 1020, indicating progress against female infanticide. </p>



<p>However, in crime statistics the picture is worrisome. The NCRB found criminal cases against women per 100,000 population are significantly higher in states like Delhi (144.4) and Haryana (118.7) than the national average.</p>



<p>It’s clear that India’s challenge is both similar to and worse than global trends. Like many countries, India struggles with under-reporting and stigma. But deeply rooted gender bias and large population density mean even a small percentage of unreported crimes translates to very high absolute numbers. </p>



<p>Comparing international data underscores that every country has a stake in solutions – from enforcing international conventions to sharing best practices. India’s recent improvements in laws and awareness are positive, but the on-ground reality still lags behind many peers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WOMEN-EMPOWERMENT-IN-INDIA-Initiatives-Driving-Chang-Change-1-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14206" style="width:352px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WOMEN-EMPOWERMENT-IN-INDIA-Initiatives-Driving-Chang-Change-1-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WOMEN-EMPOWERMENT-IN-INDIA-Initiatives-Driving-Chang-Change-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WOMEN-EMPOWERMENT-IN-INDIA-Initiatives-Driving-Chang-Change-1-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WOMEN-EMPOWERMENT-IN-INDIA-Initiatives-Driving-Chang-Change-1.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-empowering-women-and-girls-the-role-of-smile-foundation">Empowering women and girls – The role of Smile Foundation</h2>



<p>Stopping crimes against women requires prevention and empowerment, not just punishment. Smile Foundation addresses root causes by empowering women and girls in vulnerable communities. Our flagship <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/donation/women-empowerment" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Swabhiman</a> programme </strong>(launched in 2005) offers a holistic mix of health, nutrition, and livelihood support to marginalised women. </p>



<p>Swabhiman helps women start microenterprises, learn financial literacy, and access healthcare. For instance, Smile provides skill training (e.g. sewing, farming) along with seed capital, so beneficiaries can earn their own income.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="640" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7-2-1024x640.jpg" alt="How livelihoods define our lives?" class="wp-image-9336" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7-2-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7-2-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7-2-768x480.jpg 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7-2-1200x750.jpg 1200w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7-2.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><em><strong>Image: </strong></em>A Smile Foundation beneficiary uses vocational training (here, tailoring) and support to build a <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" title="Livelihood" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2645" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">livelihood</a>. Programmes like Swabhiman equip women with skills, tools and awareness, enabling them to earn independently.</p>



<p>Smile’s approach ties into broader development goals by combining reproductive health awareness with entrepreneurship, Swabhiman makes women more self-reliant. In practical terms, <strong>nearly 190,000 women</strong> across six states have benefitted from Swabhiman in recent years. These women learn to plan family health, start savings, and even lead local groups. For example, in Maharashtra Smile recounts how <em>Ishwati</em> – once a daily-wage laborer – received seeds, a pump and training to start farming. She now <strong>earns about ₹10,000</strong> from selling her crops, supplementing her family’s income and inspiring others in her village. Stories like hers show that when women gain skills and confidence, they can resist exploitation and lift their families out of poverty.</p>



<p>Smile also focuses on educating and empowering girls. Our <strong><em><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/donation/support-girl-child" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">She Can Fly</a></em></strong> initiative (alongside other campaigns) encourages girls to stay in school, get vocational training and focus on health and nutrition. Educated girls are far less likely to be married off early or fall prey to traffickers. By promoting financial literacy and life skills, Smile helps girls become <strong>change agents</strong> in their own communities. Together, these programmes aim to reduce vulnerability. We believe that an informed, skilled woman is better able to assert her rights and avoid abusive situations.</p>



<p>For donors and policymakers, Smile’s impact is a model worth supporting. The organisation’s integrated work – combining <strong>nutrition programmes</strong>, <strong>reproductive health camps</strong>, and <strong>women’s entrepreneurship</strong> – addresses several risk factors for violence. Recognising this, Smile aligns with national schemes (like Anemia Mukt Bharat and Poshan Abhiyan) to strengthen government initiatives. </p>



<p>Our partnerships have helped set up community kitchens, support mothers’ groups, and equip health workers to be more responsive to women’s needs. In short, Smile Foundation illustrates how empowerment and awareness can complement laws to actually reduce crimes against women.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-can-be-done"><strong>What can be done</strong></h2>



<p>Experts emphasise a multi-pronged approach by educating boys and girls about gender equality, sensitising communities, strictly enforcing laws, and expanding support for survivors. Engaging youth is vital – curricula and media must challenge stereotypes that condone violence. Policymakers must ensure funding for women’s shelters, legal aid, and healthcare is adequate and effectively used. The public can play a role by supporting and volunteering with NGOs like Smile that empower at-risk women.</p>



<p>Real change also needs cultural shifts. Indian society must move beyond protective attitudes to genuinely value women’s autonomy. Everyday citizens can help by speaking out against harassment, supporting survivors, and demanding accountability. Even small steps – a bystander intervening in public harassment, or communities educating young couples about mutual respect – can add up.</p>



<p>In India and around the world, ending crimes against women will require everyone’s effort. The legal toolbox is in place, but enforcement and social support must be strengthened. Programmes like Smile Foundation’s Swabhiman and She Can Fly show that empowering women economically and socially can break the cycle of abuse. By combining legal remedies with education and opportunity, society can turn the tide – ensuring every woman and girl can live free of violence.</p>

<p>Well-functioning Anganwadi Centres are the backbone of India’s early childhood development and maternal-child health programmes. Nearly <strong><a href="https://www.godrejfoundation.com/blogs/fifty-years-of-anganwadis-are-they-effective-pre-schools#:~:text=In%202025%2C%20as%20the%20scheme,and%20supplementary%20nutrition%20at%20anganwadis" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">14 lakh Anganwadis</a></strong> across India serve as the first point of contact for nutrition, health monitoring, and preschool education for rural and urban poor children. In 2025, these centres provide hot meals, immunisations and growth tracking for 0–6 year-olds, and critical prenatal/postnatal care to pregnant and lactating women. </p>



<p>ASER 2024 data show that Anganwadis are the biggest provider of pre-primary school services, with over half of all 3–4 year olds enrolled there. These figures highlight that Anganwadis not only fight malnutrition (child undernutrition fell from ~30% in 1975 to 7.7% by 2019–21) but also prime millions of children for school.</p>



<p>Across India, Anganwadis are often simple village centres providing early <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2636" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> and nutrition. Upgrading these facilities as advocated by NEP 2020 is essential for quality learning and <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2634" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-glaring-anganwadi-infrastructure-gaps-undermine-outcomes"><strong>Glaring Anganwadi infrastructure gaps undermine outcomes</strong></h2>



<p>On-the-ground surveys reveal alarming deficits in Anganwadi infrastructure. Recent data from Telangana expose how thousands of centres lack basic amenities. Out of <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/telangana/2025/Jul/02/41-per-cent-anganwadis-lack-electricity-over-30-per-cent-have-no-toilet-facilities#:~:text=Data%20accessed%20by%20TNIE%20reveals,healthy%20and%20dignified%20learning%20environment" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">35,700 Anganwadis</a> surveyed, 41% (14,866 centres) had no electricity, crippling lighting, ventilation, and cold-storage of vaccines and supplements. Similarly, 32.5% (11,595 centres) had no toilet facilities, jeopardising sanitation and dignity, especially for girls and women. And 16.8% (5,981 centres) lacked drinking water access. These gaps directly violate Swachh Bharat and Poshan Abhiyaan goals, and mirror a wider pattern.</p>



<p>A 2020 NITI Aayog review found that a majority of Anganwadis still operate in rented or makeshift spaces, not permanent government-built rooms. The consequences are crumbling walls, overcrowding, and AWWs unable to teach or even cook mid-day meals. For example, in one Odisha Anganwadi shown below, children sit under a leaking roof, illustrating the urgent need for upgrades.</p>



<p>Many Anganwadis today lack safe, child-friendly buildings. In rural Odisha (pictured), a worn-down Anganwadi centre struggles to serve mothers and children in inadequate space, underscoring why state action is needed.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-case-for-renewed-investment"><strong>The case for renewed investment</strong></h2>



<p>As NEP 2020 notes, the early years are crucial not just for physical development but also cognitive and emotional growth. High-quality, child-friendly infrastructure (safe classrooms, play areas, sanitation, and power) is now explicitly mandated by policy. Indeed, states like UP and Maharashtra are hiring dedicated pre-school teachers and rolling out new curricula in Anganwadis. But to meet these goals, existing centres must be upgraded in tandem.</p>



<p>In practical terms, infrastructure translates to a well-lit, ventilated Anganwadi with clean water and toilets. It boosts attendance, learning and health. In Telangana, Anganwadi Workers report they cannot adopt digital or creative teaching methods without electricity. When toilets and water are absent, young children, and caregivers face illness and indignity. Conversely, interventions that improve the centre environment (e.g. furniture, cooking facilities, kitchen gardens) lead to higher community trust and programme uptake.</p>



<p><strong>Smile Foundation’s own experience confirms this. </strong>With PepsiCo Foundation, Smile implemented the <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/smile-foundation-and-pepsico-join-forces-to-strengthen-healthcare-and-nutrition-for-underserved-communities/#:~:text=Complementing%20this%20effort%20is%20the,community%20engagement%2C%20260%20health%20camps" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Nutrition Enhancement Programme (NEP)</a></strong> in rural Punjab. Over three years, NEP improved maternal-child nutrition in 23 villages of Sangrur, reaching 60,000 people. This CSR-backed initiative directly benefited 16,000 pregnant/lactating women and children and indirectly another 45,000, through 260 health camps, kitchen gardens and AWW training. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ChatGPT-Image-Jul-25-2025-08_29_56-PM-683x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14167" style="width:370px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ChatGPT-Image-Jul-25-2025-08_29_56-PM-683x1024.png 683w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ChatGPT-Image-Jul-25-2025-08_29_56-PM-200x300.png 200w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ChatGPT-Image-Jul-25-2025-08_29_56-PM-768x1152.png 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ChatGPT-Image-Jul-25-2025-08_29_56-PM.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></figure>



<p>Likewise, in Kosi (Mathura, UP), the recent <strong><a href="https://thecsrjournal.in/corporate-social-responsibility-csr-news-pepsico-india-and-smile-foundation-partner-to-combat-anaemia-and-malnutrition-in-kosi-through-pink-smile-initiative/#:~:text=,Officer%20of%20the%20Nandgaon%20block" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Pink Smile</a></strong> project (PepsiCo–Smile) deployed mobile medical units and community camps to screen and treat anemia for 4,200 vulnerable women and children. These projects underscore how supporting Anganwadi-based care yields immediate health gains.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smile-foundation-s-anganwadi-infrastructure-initiatives"><strong>Smile Foundation’s Anganwadi infrastructure initiatives</strong></h2>



<p>Building on this evidence, Smile Foundation has launched dedicated Anganwadi infrastructure programmes through <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" title="Corporate Partnerships" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2635" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">CSR</a> partnerships. In Maharashtra, the <strong><a href="https://thecsrjournal.in/csr-news-non-profit-foundations-empower-lives-anganwadi-transformation-pune/#:~:text=,Anganwadi%20workers%20and%20local%20families" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Mars Wrigley Foundation’s Community Connection grant</a></strong> empowered us to revamp 10 Anganwadi Centres (AWCs) across Pune. Over 2024–25 we revitalised 10 AWCs, impacting 13 centres overall, reaching 1,562 direct beneficiaries (children, mothers, adolescent girls) and 4,660 community members. </p>



<p>Key upgrades included 202 kitchen gardens to improve food security, 30 health/haemoglobin screening camps, and training for Anganwadi workers. We provided furniture, learning materials and safe sanitation creating cleaner, child-friendly learning spaces.</p>



<p>Similarly, under our <strong>Women Empowerment (<a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/women-empowerment/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Swabhiman</a>)</strong> programme in Tamil Nadu, Odisha and other states, Smile has supported Anganwadi upgrades by building toilets, installing solar lights, and water filters, and training AWWs in hygiene and nutrition. Our anaemia and nutrition mobile units also regularly link families to their Anganwadi Centres. All these efforts from Assam to Andhra Pradesh illustrate Smile’s conviction that investing in Anganwadis today builds healthier, more educated communities tomorrow.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-practical-csr-partnerships-for-lasting-impact"><strong>Practical CSR partnerships for lasting impact</strong></h2>



<p>For CSR leaders seeking high-impact opportunities, Anganwadi upgradation should be a strategic priority. We recommend:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Adopt &amp; Upgrade:</strong> Corporates can &#8216;adopt&#8217; clusters of Anganwadis (or a mini-Anganwadi cluster) in partnership with NGOs like us. Funding can go to core infrastructure like permanent classrooms, clean toilets, borewells or piped water, electricity/smart lighting, boundary walls, and kitchen equipment.</li>



<li><strong>Nutrition &amp; Nurture:</strong> Enhance the centre’s nutrition role by sponsoring kitchen gardens, community nutrition workshops, and improved kitchen-cum-store facilities. These immediately improve the meal program’s reach.</li>



<li><strong>Capacity Building:</strong> Invest in training Anganwadi workers (AWWs/AWHs) on early childhood pedagogy, health screening, digital tools and gender sensitivity so that physical upgrades yield programme quality gains.</li>



<li><strong>Monitoring &amp; Community:</strong> Collaborate with local panchayats and beneficiaries in planning; involve employees as volunteers (e.g. helping refurbish centres). Set measurable outcomes (enrollment, health indicators, attendance) and share progress publicly.</li>
</ul>



<p>The government’s own task force advises that <strong>public-private partnerships (PPPs)</strong> are vital to bridge the gap in ICDS service delivery. By partnering with NGOs like Smile Foundation who bring field expertise, CSR units can ensure sustainable models. For example, Mars Wrigley’s multi-year support combined fresh infrastructure inputs with IEC campaigns and AWW training. Such integrated projects create lasting change far beyond a one-time donation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-child-friendly-futures"><strong>Building child-friendly futures</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="869" height="813" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-202910.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14168" style="width:372px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-202910.png 869w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-202910-300x281.png 300w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-202910-768x719.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></figure>



<p>Well-equipped Anganwadi centres are an enabler of national development. They lay the foundation for healthier, smarter generations. </p>



<p>Smile Foundation calls on policymakers and CSR leaders to make Anganwadi upgradation a national mission. By collectively funding and maintaining model Anganwadis, India can accelerate the goals of POSHAN Abhiyaan, Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao, and universal preschool education. Every rupee invested yields returns in reduced malnutrition, better schooling outcomes and empowered mothers. We urge CSR heads to engage <a href="cp@smilefoundationindia.org" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">now</a>. Your strategic CSR priorities can transform Anganwadis into vibrant community hubs, ensuring no child misses out on a strong start in life.</p>



<p><strong>Sources:</strong> Government and media reports highlight the infrastructural shortfalls in Anganwadis, and policy analyses recommend urgent upgrades. The outcomes of Smile Foundation’s CSR partnerships (with PepsiCo, Mars Wrigley, etc.) document the impact of targeted Anganwadi improvements. All facts and figures above are drawn from these reports and our project data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>India’s villages are bursting with youthful promise, but chronic infrastructure gaps keep many rural children in the dark—literally and figuratively. A recent Parliamentary report notes that only about 56.5% of government schools have electricity. This leaves nearly half of rural learners studying by daylight or kerosene lamp, cut off from the <strong>smart education </strong>the world now offers. </p>



<p>Government data show that barely 57% of schools even have computers and 54% have any Internet access. The result is inequality in urban and rural space. For example, in Delhi a vast majority of schools are digitally equipped, but in Bihar only 18.5% have Internet. In this setting, blending solar-powered infrastructure and digital classrooms can be a game-changer enabling round-the-clock electricity and internet even off the grid. </p>



<p>One Smile Foundation case study reports, in Odisha’s remote Kalahandi district schools once lacking desks and often even teachers have been transformed under Digital India. Today they boast <strong>internet connectivity, smart boards, and e-learning platforms</strong>. Lessons that once felt abstract now come alive on screens. These quiet revolutions show how renewable-energy upgrades and EdTech can leapfrog rural schools over decades of neglect.</p>



<p>Solar classrooms are more than a modern convenience. They are vital green infrastructure for the future. A 2022 expert study of Madhya Pradesh’s Harda district found that electrifying four rural schools and <em>anganwadis </em>with rooftop solar (and simple battery backups) boosted student attendance and enabled evening study sessions. Children could finally use smart classes, computers and the internet once there was light. Measured outcomes were impressive. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="724" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Electricity-1024x724.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14222" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Electricity-1024x724.jpg 1024w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Electricity-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Electricity-768x543.jpg 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Electricity-1536x1086.jpg 1536w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Electricity-1200x848.jpg 1200w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Electricity-1980x1400.jpg 1980w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Electricity.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Over a year the PV systems generated ~2,250 kWh of clean energy, saved ₹18,000 in utility costs, cut carbon emissions by 47 tonnes (equivalent to planting 74 mature teak trees), and unlocked water-pumping for clean drinking water. In the words of the implementers, the quality of light from electricity, often LEDs, is much better and more efficient, directly improving learning conditions. Such results echo global evidence. UNESCO’s new <strong>Green School Quality Standard</strong> explicitly calls for solar panels to provide a reliable energy source during electrical blackouts and drive climate action in schools.</p>



<p>Together, solar roofs and digital classrooms form a powerful green infrastructure  ecosystem. Solar panels on school roofs provide clean, off-grid power for ICT labs, water pumps, and safe lights. Classrooms become living labs where children literally plug into sustainability. Smile Foundation has facilitated solar panel installations in several partner education centres across nine states. These panels not only save energy costs, they are teaching tools with students learning first hand how renewable energy works and why it matters. The result is improved schooling today and a generation fluent in climate resilience. </p>



<p>As one Smile-backed <strong>Smart Classroom </strong>project found, solarisation plus tablets and interactive boards made learning interactive, engaging, and empowering in places long marked by deprivation. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="653" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-151214-1024x653.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14105" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-151214-1024x653.png 1024w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-151214-300x191.png 300w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-151214-768x490.png 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-151214-1536x979.png 1536w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-151214-1200x765.png 1200w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-151214.png 1545w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Critically, these green education initiatives align with India’s development schemes and global goals. The Union Government’s <em><strong>Samagra Shiksha</strong> </em>programme (the integrated school education scheme) now explicitly lets states use school electricity budgets to invest in solar/hybrid systems to ensure sustainability. Likewise, flagship campaigns like <strong>Digital India</strong> and the National Education Policy 2020 call for 24×7 schooling facilities and universal connectivity, which require steady power. </p>



<p>On the global front, UNESCO’s Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) agenda and the Greening Education Partnership stress climate-informed pedagogy and school infrastructure. UNESCO highlights that schools must walk the talk by greening learning environments. In fact, the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development ties these threads neatly. SDG&nbsp;4 (quality education) and SDG&nbsp;7 (affordable clean energy) intersect in solar classrooms, while SDG&nbsp;13 (climate action) is advanced when students adopt renewable power. Smile Foundation’s work is a microcosm of this synergy. Our projects are mapped to multiple SDGs, and indeed they now <strong>benefit 75,000+ students across 500+ schools</strong> in 9 states with these green-learning investments.</p>



<p><strong>Smile Foundation </strong>has long championed rural education and gender equity. In recent years, we have brought solar and digital tech to the fore. Our <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Mission Education</a></strong> centres now include <strong>Smart Classrooms</strong> equipped with projectors, tablets, and offline e-content – all powered by rooftop solar. This has <strong>enriched learning</strong> for thousands of underserved children. </p>



<p>For example, in 2024 Smile and partners installed solar-powered digital classrooms in government schools across <strong>Assam, Meghalaya, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Haryana</strong>. These six states were chosen specifically for their high need of both electrification and digital access. By incorporating solar energy, the project emphasises sustainable practices within the educational sector while fostering an atmosphere conducive to 21st-century learning. Students no longer struggle with power cuts or mobile blackouts; instead, they use laptops and projectors every day.</p>



<p>The outcomes are measurable and inspiring. Smile reports that its tech upgrades have directly impacted <strong>75,000 children</strong> <strong>in 2024</strong>, turning classrooms into hubs of climate action. Teachers now integrate interactive climate content into all subjects. Students at a Smile centre designed water rockets and roller coasters to learn physics, linking science to sustainability. Girls in these programmes are especially empowered. </p>



<p>Earlier girls’ education campaigns (<strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/donation/support-girl-child" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">She Can Fly</a></strong>) and career fairs have built momentum, and now girls in rural classrooms actively engage with digital learning and STEM through Smile’s OJT and STEM labs. Parents and community elders also notice a change. In places with solar classrooms, villagers report longer school hours, higher attendance, and a revived respect for education. Children who previously trudged home after noon now stay back for evening classes under electric lights, boosting study time and retention. In tribal Harda district, officials saw attendance rise immediately after panels went up with energy access driving higher enrolment and retention in school.</p>



<p>Quantitative gains are evident in learning metrics too. After technology interventions, tests scores and digital literacy jump. One study by Smile’s team showed rural students exposed to tablets and e-lessons bridged about 60-70% of the learning gap compared to urban peers, particularly in maths and English. Computer education classes, once rare in small schools, are now routine. Perhaps most telling, Smile reports that anecdotally girls’s participation in STEM doubled in schools with solar-powered labs (from 20% to over 45% of STEM club members). Young women on the solar-team become role models, saying if these panels can power our classroom, surely I can power my future.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-policy-and-partnership-levers"><strong>Policy and partnership levers</strong></h4>



<p>These on-the-ground results didn’t happen by accident. We leveraged multiple policy and funding streams. Samagra Shiksha has earmarked funds for ICT labs and even suggests solar in the recurring budget. The <strong>Digital India</strong> and <strong>PM eVidya</strong> campaigns, launched during Covid, have built nationwide e-learning content (DIKSHA, SWAYAM, etc.) but their impact depends on power.</p>



<p>Clearly, electrification and solar schemes must align with education budgets. Initiatives like <strong>Saubhagya</strong> (universal household electrification) and <strong>PM-KUSUM</strong> (solar pumps for farmers) exemplify the government’s rural solar push; extending similar focus to schools is logical. In fact, MPs on the HRD Committee have urged a <strong>Green Schools Fund </strong>to install solar everywhere.</p>



<p>Beyond government, corporate <a class="wpil_keyword_link" title="Corporate Partnerships" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2626" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">CSR</a> is a huge enabler. India’s Companies Act mandates ~2% of profits go to CSR. Many corporations now target that money at education and sustainability. We have successfully partnered with firms to our education programme to fund tech labs and solar kits. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-climate-resilient-impact"><strong>Climate-resilient impact</strong></h4>



<p>Importantly, solarised schools promote more than literacy; they build climate resilience. Rural areas face increasing heatwaves and storms – governments and UNESCO urge adaptation in education. UNESCO’s Green Schools framework even calls for flood-resistant classrooms and reliable off-grid power. Solar roofs, rainwater harvesting, and shade trees become part of green infrastructure on campus.</p>



<p>When Smile students plant native saplings and monitor their survival, they live SDG&nbsp;13 by converting learning spaces into <strong>green belts</strong> around school. One Smile tree-planting initiative in Maharashtra engaged 2,000 kids in planting 30,000 saplings – these not only sequester carbon but teach stewardship. Such projects forge a virtuous cycle: greener campuses reduce heat inside classrooms and lower energy needs. And with solar panels, a school’s carbon footprint plummets – as the Harda case shows, just a few panels offset tens of tonnes of CO₂.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-data-shows"><strong>What the data shows</strong></h4>



<p>Multiple surveys underscore these benefits. The UDISE+ (national school census) data cited by Smile reveal that millions of Indian children lack access to even basic digital infrastructure. But recent upticks are promising. For example, Education For All in India’s analysis of UDISE 2021–22 found that in some states like Uttar Pradesh solar adoption is rising (8.8% of schools had panels, up sharply in aided vs. govt schools), though many states still lag (e.g. only 3–4% in WB or Assam). This means huge potential remains untapped. Every percentage point of schools solarised could reach hundreds of thousands of students. Modeling studies show that increasing solar in schools directly correlates with improved learning outcomes. For instance, UDISE data cited in research suggest that schools with reliable lighting see 10–15% higher enrolment and exam pass rates compared to dark schools.</p>



<p>Another key metric is digital literacy. India’s National ICT Literacy Index (2023) shows rural-urban gaps of 20 percentage points, with girls trailing boys by 10 points in connectivity. In Smile-supported villages, mobile-computer literacy camps have pushed up women’s digital skills by ~30%. Anecdotally, girls in solar classrooms report newfound confidence: one 14-year-old girl from Jharkhand said, “I can now use a laptop confidently to help my siblings with homework without fear of grid failure.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-scaling-up-with-policy-action"><strong>Scaling up with policy action</strong></h4>



<p>To ensure every child benefits, we need smarter policy coordination:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Integrate Solar into All School Schemes:</strong> Samagra Shiksha and state education budgets should mandate solar kits as part of new school buildings and retrofits, just as they mandate toilets and ramps. States can issue dedicated guidelines (like the clause in Samagra allowing solar for sustainability). The Centre could create a <strong>Solar Schools</strong> component in national programmes, similar to how smart classrooms were funded.</li>



<li><strong>Link Education and Energy Planning:</strong> Renewable-energy schemes (PM-KUSUM, rooftop solar missions) should explicitly include schools and <em>Anganwadis </em>as priority installations. For example, Rural Development funds or CSR solar pumps might co-finance schools’ microgrids. Similarly, rural electrification efforts (e.g. Saubhagya or BharatNet connectivity) should be coordinated with Samagra districts, ensuring simultaneous rollout of power, net, and smart-boards.</li>



<li><strong>Finance via CSR and Philanthropy:</strong> The government can incentivise greater CSR in this sector by recognising climate-and-education projects as doubly impactful. Tax breaks or matching grants could reward companies that fund solar-education collabs. Impact bonds and blended finance could also be used. For instance, a green bond for rural education infrastructure, with pay outs tied to metrics like enrolment or test scores.</li>



<li><strong>Cross-Sector Partnerships:</strong> NGOs, corporates, and local governments must co-design solutions. Smile’s digital-cum-solar classroom in Haryana, done with state education officers’ buy-in, is a model. National bodies (like the NITI Aayog’s Atal Innovation Mission or the CSR Research Foundation) could convene task forces to replicate best practices across states. Teacher-training institutes should include modules on using solar/ICT tools. Universities (like IITs) could donate expertise in low-cost solar tech for schools.</li>



<li><strong>Promote Climate Education:</strong> The curriculum itself should reflect this infrastructure. If a school has solar panels, students should use them as teaching aids in math and science. Textbooks and online courses must highlight renewable tech projects happening locally. UNESCO’s <strong>Education for Sustainable Development</strong> framework emphasises learning by doing – school solar projects are tailor-made for such pedagogy.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-challenges-and-sustainability"><strong>Challenges and sustainability</strong></h2>



<p>Of course, hurdles remain. Maintenance of solar kits, digital hardware, and connectivity can be tricky in remote areas. Govt schools often lack IT technicians, and panels require periodic cleaning. Here too, solutions exist. Solar vendors now often offer 5-year maintenance contracts. Rural youth clubs can be trained (perhaps under the “Skill India” umbrella) to service school systems, creating local jobs. Internet backhaul can piggyback on village panchayat networks or BharatNet. Importantly, communities must co-own these assets. Smile’s model involves School Management Committees in each phase, ensuring parents and local leaders invest in upkeep.</p>



<p>Financially, the long-term gains justify the costs. Solar installations have a 10–15 year payback from bill savings. Economic analyses show that every rupee invested in rural education yields ~₹4–5 in lifetime economic benefits from higher productivity. With green infrastructure, the environmental externalities (avoided pollution, climate resilience) stack on top. Thus multilateral agencies like the World Bank and ADB are increasingly funding “green schools”. India should tap such funds and align them with domestic CSR/ADB projects (note ADB’s own support for off-grid solar schools).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-equity-through-green-education"><strong>Equity through green education</strong></h2>



<p>In the 21st century, <strong>green infrastructure</strong> is as essential to education as desks and books. Solar-powered digital classrooms embody a perfect synergy. They deliver electricity, clean energy, and global knowledge to doorstep villages. By merging renewable energy and EdTech, India can ensure that being born in a far-flung panchayat no longer means a second-tier schooling. Instead, it can be a stepping stone in the <strong>Equitable, Sustainable Education</strong> envisioned by the SDGs.</p>



<p>Smile Foundation experience shows it’s doable. Hundreds of schools across nine states, thousands of lives changed, and children inspired to be “eco-warriors”. Now, the task is to scale up rapidly through policy, partnerships, and funding. By embedding solar into every rural school and coupling it with quality digital content, India advances toward <em>Samagra Shiksha</em> for real – not just brick-and-mortar, but a full spectrum of facilities. This cross-sector approach – government norms, private CSR, civil-society innovation – can finally make electricity and internet as commonplace in rural India’s classrooms as pencils and notebooks. In doing so, we do more than light up blackboards. We ignite young minds to become the <strong>green leaders</strong> India needs.</p>

<p>Every morning before dawn, Dhanam, a small business owner in Chennai, prepares her idli stall for the day. Fatigue was her constant companion till a free checkup by the Smile on Wheels mobile medical unit revealed that she had diabetes. With access to timely guidance and care delivered close to home, she has been able to manage both her health and her livelihood without missing a single customer in a day.</p>



<p>While India’s urban medical infrastructure has emerged as a global benchmark attracting international patients with its world-class hospitals and advanced treatments, the same cannot be said for rural healthcare. But this sheen of excellence fades quickly as one moves beyond city limits. In rural and underserved areas, healthcare is often an afterthought which remains delayed, distant, and fragmented.</p>



<p>The issue is not only the absence of hospitals or beds, but the critical shortage of skilled and often overlooked, shortage of skilled healthcare workers. Hospitals and clinics can be built, but without trained professionals to staff them, they remain symbols of intent rather than engines of impact.</p>



<p>A healthcare system without trained caregivers is a system destined to fail. For business leaders, CSR professionals, and policymakers, this challenge also presents an opportunity. Investing in rural health is a strategic investment in the nation’s social and economic infrastructure. Strengthening the rural health workforce fuels productivity, resilience, and long-term development goals. It ensures that no life remains unreachable, and that India’s rural healthcare transformation is truly inclusive.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rural-healthcare-workforce-deficit"><strong>Rural Healthcare Workforce Deficit</strong></h2>



<p>In India where healthcare professionals are often revered as “gods,” the expansion of modern hospitals, rising numbers of medical graduates, and a growing private sector have created an impression that quality healthcare is now within reach for all. Yet this perception masks the troubling truth that in countless remote villages across India, even a basic medical consultation remains out of reach. The closest doctor may be hours away, and trained nurses are often absent from the local primary health centre.&nbsp;</p>



<p>India’s rural healthcare system continues to fight the crisis of the acute shortage of trained human resources. Despite sustained government efforts and targeted interventions, the lack of doctors, nurses, and frontline workers in rural India remains one of the most critical barriers to delivering equitable care. Several interlocking factors explain why rural India remains on the wrong side of this imbalance.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Geographical maldistribution and urban preference&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Despite an overall increase in medical graduates over the year, recent surveys suggest that India has approximately <a href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=1581325" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">1:1456 of doctor-population ratio</a> contradicting the WHO standards of 1:1000. A key challenge lies in the urban concentration of medical professionals. Increasingly, doctors are opting for city-based careers, drawn by better professional opportunities, higher earning potential in the private sector, and superior living conditions. This growing urban preference has contributed to the persistent difficulty in staffing rural healthcare facilities leaving large swathes of India underserved and vulnerable.</p>



<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Unsupportive rural working conditions&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Persistent gaps in infrastructure such as unreliable electricity, limited access to clean water, inadequate staff housing, and non-functional diagnostic tools continue to plague rural healthcare systems in India. For doctors and medical personnel posted in remote areas, the lack of quality schooling for their children and the absence of secure, livable environments for both work and residence present additional barriers. These challenges collectively discourage healthcare workers from accepting or continuing rural postings, reinforcing the urban-rural divide in access to essential health services.</p>



<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Urban-centric medical education system&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Medical and nursing education in India remains largely centred around tertiary care, with limited emphasis on preparing professionals for the realities of rural practice. This urban-centric training leaves graduates ill-equipped and often unwilling to serve in underserved regions. Compounding the issue is the stark mismatch between the number of MBBS graduates and the availability of postgraduate seats, pushing many aspiring doctors to forego rural postings in pursuit of further academic opportunities—a trade-off that continues to weaken frontline care in rural India.</p>



<ol start="4" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Systemic delays and administrative inefficiencies&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Recruitment to India’s rural healthcare centres is often hindered by delayed processes, lack of transparent vacancy notifications, and bureaucratic red tape. These systemic inefficiencies not only slow down staffing but also deter many young medical professionals from applying to Primary Health Centres (PHCs) and Community Health Centres (CHCs), further deepening the rural health workforce crisis.</p>



<p>According to recent surveys, 65% of India’s total population lives in <a href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1894901#:~:text=The%20Survey%20notes%20that%2065,women%20and%20children%20have%20improved." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">rural areas</a>. Given this demographic reality, it is imperative to assess whether the country’s healthcare workforce aligns with the needs of its rural citizens.</p>



<p>Alarming data from the National Medical Journal of India indicates a shortfall of nearly <a href="https://nmji.in/view-pdf/?article=388b539aa87f7de466ae5d509bd03f00mRkcqV67lQc%3D" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">80% in rural healthcare staffing</a>, even as infrastructure has expanded. Since 2005, India has witnessed a 63.8% increase in the number of Community Health Centres (CHCs). As of 2022, there were 5,480 CHCs operational in rural areas, supplemented by 584 in urban settings. In tribal regions, 960 CHCs have been established, signalling a concerted effort to reach historically underserved populations.</p>



<p>Notably, states such as Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and Bihar have led the way in expanding healthcare infrastructure, reflecting targeted efforts to mitigate regional health disparities. However, infrastructure alone cannot deliver care without adequately trained and retained personnel, these centres risk becoming underutilised assets.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Public Health Chronicles</em>*</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-government-initiative-for-healthcare-in-india"><strong>Government initiative for healthcare in India </strong></h3>



<p>In alignment with Sustainable Development Goal 3 and India’s health priorities, the government is working to build a more inclusive and resilient healthcare system, especially in underserved regions. Recent reforms focus on strengthening frontline infrastructure, expanding workforce capacity, and leveraging digital solutions to close critical service gaps.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs):<br></strong>These centres provide comprehensive primary care including maternal and child services, NCD screenings, and essential medicines bringing preventive and promotive healthcare closer to rural communities.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>National Health Mission (NHM):</strong>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Launched in 2013, NHM integrates rural and urban health missions, emphasizing decentralized planning, community engagement, and system-wide improvements.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Human Resource Reforms:</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Using Rural Health Statistics to guide decisions, policy measures now target recruitment bottlenecks, workforce incentives, and training reforms to ensure skilled personnel reach India’s remotest health centres.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-human-resources-for-health-the-critical-pillar-of-indian-rural-healthcare"><strong>Human resources for health &#8211; The critical pillar of Indian rural healthcare</strong></h4>



<p>The World Health Organization defines the Human Resources for Health (HRH) as all individuals engaged in promoting, protecting or improving public health. It includes clinical care, public health interventions, research, management and support services. (WHO,2007). Their role and capacity directly influences health outcomes and system efficiency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When there is a&nbsp; <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11110446/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">low HRH density, </a>its direct impact is seen in increased maternal and child mortality, reduced life expectancy, and a growing burden of untreated mental health conditions. The shortage of healthcare givers in the rural landscape of India also becomes a concerning factor towards implementation of health policies to its full effect, disrupting continuity of care, and posing a significant barrier to achieving public health goals. Most critically, it threatens the country’s progress toward Universal Health Coverage.</p>



<p><strong>What&#8217;s needed? A people-first approach</strong></p>



<p>Like any profession, healthcare demands a robust, supportive ecosystem. One that nurtures not only clinical expertise but also professional development, career advancement, and personal well-being, especially in high-demand, resource-limited settings like rural India.</p>



<p>To address this systemic gap, health policy experts and medical academicians have put forward <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5789104/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">strategic recommendations</a> aimed at bridging the divide between trained healthcare providers and the underserved rural population. These include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Providing the medical personnels with rural healthcare fellowships programmes&nbsp;</li>



<li>Provide them with incentivised service models like housing, pay structure, and career recognitions&nbsp;</li>



<li>Strengthening community-based solutions by promoting the training of local women as ASHA workers and auxiliary nurse midwives</li>



<li>Digital upskilling and telemedicine integration</li>
</ul>



<p>These interventions recognise that rural health systems must be built from the ground up and not imposed from the top down. By encouraging local leadership, creating enabling conditions for healthcare professionals, and aligning incentives with service delivery, India can create solid, sustainable pathways for its rural health workforce.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-partnerships-that-strengthen-people-power-nbsp"><strong>Partnerships that strengthen people power&nbsp;</strong></h5>



<p>In the remote interiors of Tamil Nadu, a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLy35H0Powr/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">community of daily-wage labourers</a> survives on earnings that barely cover basic necessities. For them, healthcare was a luxury, an added financial strain they simply cannot afford.</p>



<p>However, that narrative has begun to shift. Through a strategic partnership with a leading multinational health technology firm, Smile Foundation’s <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Smile on Wheels</a> mobile medical unit now brings accessible, no-cost primary healthcare directly to their doorsteps.</p>



<p>Regular check-ups, preventive screenings, and free medicines have empowered pregnant women, children, and the elderly to take charge of their health without the anxiety of added financial burden.</p>



<p>This model demonstrates how targeted CSR partnerships can bridge systemic healthcare gaps, enabling low-resource populations to live healthier lives sustainably and with dignity.</p>



<p>Corporate Social Responsibility towards building a robust healthcare system is not a new phenomenon but definitely one of the most powerful tools to strengthen it. Since ages, corporate partnerships for healthcare have played a pivotal role in advancing the healthcare goals of the country bringing quality healthcare services and dignified lives to the underserved communities of India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, their role in solving the challenge of limited healthcare givers in India is more important to support and implement the initiatives taken by the state for a healthier India.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Support training of frontline workers in India’s rural healthcare system</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Training the rural healthcare workers strengthens community-based care, improves health outcomes and builds trust in the system. By investing time and efforts, corporate partnerships can empower women and children with better healthcare facilities, enhance workforce retention, and ensure sustained impact leading to compassion meeting the true potential of the frontline workforce in delivering quality healthcare.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Invest in technology enabled capacity building</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Technology driven solutions such as e-learning platforms, mobile medical units, and telehealth services extend the reach of quality care. These tools bridge access gaps, enable real time diagnostics, and foster last mile impact- transforming healthcare delivery for underserved communities while ensuring cost efficiency and positive impacts.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Partnering with NGOs in India to develop and deploy rural health talent pools&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>India’s higher education expansion belies that access remains deeply unequal. Despite dramatic growth in colleges and universities, only a fraction of students make it to campus. The latest government data shows that a staggering <a href="https://education.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/higher-education/the-power-of-personalised-scholarships-in-shaping-indias-future/115521316#:~:text=Primary%20and%20secondary%20school%20enrolments,to%20college%2C%20according%20to%20AISHE" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">71.6% of Indian youth</a> do not progress from high school to college. This means millions of talented students, especially from low‑income, rural, or marginalised backgrounds, never even get a chance. The reasons go beyond tuition fees. </p>



<p>For many, the pathway to college is blocked by a maze of social and institutional barriers like a lack of information and guidance, complex scholarship processes, digital and language divides, and entrenched biases around caste, gender and field of study. As <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/developing-contemporary-india/why-many-marginalised-students-cant-access-scholarships/#:~:text=too%20well%3A%20While%20scholarships%20are,system%20leaves%20too%20many%20behind" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">one recent survey</a> cautions, <strong>“scholarships are essential, [but they] often fall short of addressing the full range of challenges faced by students from marginalized backgrounds,”</strong> leaving too many behind.</p>



<p>One young woman’s story captures this gap. <strong>Aishwarya</strong>, an engineering student from a working‑class family in Bengaluru, dreamed of a science career despite her father’s modest income. “I had always dreamt of pursuing a career in science,” she recalls. Yet even after earning a coveted college seat, she struggled: <strong>“The fees, transport, books, and even mobile data for online classes started adding up. It became impossible to continue with my studies.”</strong> Aishwarya’s predicament shows why affordability alone is a reductive way to see the problem. It wasn’t just money – it was every extra cost and complication that overwhelmed her. Schools and scholarships often focus narrowly on tuition, but students like Aishwarya need a safety net that covers all essentials.</p>



<p>But money isn’t the only missing piece. Many first‑generation college students are also navigating an alien world. Classrooms, career counselling, and internship culture can feel utterly foreign to someone from a village or slum. These students may have no one at home to help write a résumé, prepare for an interview, or network professionally. In the words of one scholarship advisor, <strong>“financial aid is just one piece of the puzzle”</strong>. Without guidance, confidence and exposure, even well‑funded students can falter. </p>



<p>Research confirms that bridging “small gaps” in language, transportation, and mentorship can dramatically boost a young person’s confidence and sense of belonging. In other words, handing someone a scholarship but dropping them into a strange new environment is unlikely to yield success. As one report bluntly puts it,<strong> “without complementary support of this kind, financial aid isn’t likely to result in success.”</strong></p>



<p>To overcome these hurdles, holistic scholarship models are emerging. Rather than just paying fees, they wrap students in a blanket of support. A leading example is Smile Foundation’s flagship <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Mission Education</a></strong> programme which pairs financial aid with life‑skills training, English and digital fluency classes, mentorship, career counselling, and even mental health support. Our need‑based sponsorships cover not only school fees but also books, uniforms, stationery, and transport – ensuring continuity from primary school through higher secondary. </p>



<p>We also run bridge and remedial courses for dropouts, giving out‑of‑school youth a second chance at learning. In partnership with corporate <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" title="Corporate Partnerships" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2619" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">CSR</a> funds, Smile even extends vocational and professional scholarships for nursing, computer training and other career paths so that older students gain employable skills.</p>



<p>Girls receive special attention. Smile Foundation notes that female students face gendered expectations, mobility constraints, and lack of access to safe campuses or hostels. To counter this, their scholarships for girls are embedded in a broader strategy providing menstrual hygiene kits, counselling and safe transport arrangements alongside funding. These measures help keep girls in school with dignity and confidence. Indeed, poor infrastructure and social pressure still cause girls in India to drop out in large numbers. </p>



<p>A UNESCO survey found <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/powerful-voices-how-adolescent-girls-in-india-are-breaking-barriers-and-creating-change/#:~:text=of%20safe%20access%20to%20sex,in%20India%20remain%20unaware%20of" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><strong>23 million</strong> girls worldwide each year leave school</a> simply for lack of proper menstrual hygiene facilities – a reality Smile’s programmes directly address by providing sanitary supplies and education. By focusing on the whole student, not just the ledger sheet, holistic scholarships help remove the hidden barriers that money alone cannot fix.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-the-classroom-to-the-career"><strong>From the classroom to the career</strong></h2>



<p>Of course, going to college is only the first step. Equally important is what comes after, and here too, India faces an urgent challenge. As industry surveys repeatedly show, there is a growing <strong>employability gap</strong>. The latest India Skills Report (2025 edition) found that only about 54.81% of Indian graduates are considered job‑ready by industry standards. In other words, nearly half of college grads still lack the soft skills, digital know‑how, or career orientation that employers want. This is a dilemma for students and donors alike of a degree that doesn’t lead to a job is a missed opportunity.</p>



<p>Bridging this gap requires purposeful integration of skills and internship opportunities into scholarship programmes. Smile Foundation’s vocational scholars, for example, gain real workplace exposure through internships and industry workshops. One beneficiary, <strong>Vaishnavi</strong>, speaks for many: working a brief internship in a Mumbai office <strong>“changed my self-perception entirely,” she says. “Until then, I never thought someone like me could work in a place like that… Now I know I can.”</strong> This transformation, from classroom confidence to career confidence, is exactly the aim.</p>



<p>Smaller initiatives aren’t enough; we need system‑wide change. India’s National Education Policy 2020 (NEP) acknowledges this by calling for stronger links between academia and industry. In practice, NEP mandates that universities experiment with vocational education and include mandatory internships and apprenticeships in their curricula. CSR partnerships can accelerate this by helping align college curricula with real job skills, sponsor laboratory facilities, or digital labs, and mentor students. Several Indian CSR guidelines now encourage firms to support educational initiatives, and many companies do fund scholarship seats but often without the accompanying training. For true impact, CSR‑funded scholarships should come bundled with career bootcamps, group discussions, mock interviews, and internships.</p>



<p>Such public‑private collaboration also builds social capital. When students meet mentors and industry leaders, they learn the norms of professional life – the resume buzzwords, presentation etiquette, and networking savvy that others pick up informally. These interactions set realistic expectations and open doors. If a bright rural student sits down with an engineer who once came from a similar village, she gains both inspiration and guidance. As Smile Foundation’s scholarship head emphasises, the goal is to ensure students aren’t just enrolled, but ready for the workplace. With this model, a scholarship becomes a ladder from school all the way into a career.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-definition-of-access"><strong>A new definition of “Access”</strong></h2>



<p>At its core, this approach asks us to redefine “access” to higher education. Access isn’t achieved the moment a student steps through the college gate; it is truly realised only when she completes her degree and walks into a job that matches her potential. This shift changes everything. Students who receive wraparound support – mentorship, life skills training, and career exposure – have dramatically higher retention and graduation rates. In fact, they build what educators call <strong>identity capital</strong>: the confidence, connections, and self‑understanding that let them convert an education into opportunity. One study of peer‑mentoring camps found that <strong><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/powerful-voices-how-adolescent-girls-in-india-are-breaking-barriers-and-creating-change/#:~:text=who%20later%20became%20Sakhis,the%20cycle%20can%20be%20broken" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">96% of disadvantaged girls went on to higher education</a></strong> when given comprehensive support.</p>



<p>These success stories ripple outward. A single girl who becomes a professional can transform the aspirations of her whole community. Her siblings see her example and dare to dream; her parents feel vindicated in educating daughters. In the long run, every such scholar is a social mobility agent. In economic terms, investing in holistic scholarships is like investing in a multiplier, one income‑earning graduate can indirectly benefit dozens of others.</p>



<p>For donors and CSR leaders, the implication is clear that funding fees is necessary, but not sufficient. Smart investments target multiple needs simultaneously. For example, Smile Foundation in 2023 reached 120,000 students with educational programmes, supported 44,000 girls with school and vocational training, and funded 2,000 scholarships for higher studies. These efforts are not stand‑alone; they are integrated with teacher training, lab upgrades and <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2620" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> campaigns. An evaluator might not see the tagline “scholarship” on every initiative, but together they form a ladder that keeps students climbing.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rethinking-the-scholarship-model"><strong>Rethinking the scholarship model</strong></h2>



<p>There is no one-size-fits-all solution, but certain principles have emerged:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Simplify and localise the process:</strong> Make applications user-friendly, available in regional languages, and accessible through a single portal. As YDF researchers note, the current system “often falls short” because students face underused online portals and confusing forms. Providing local outreach and translation can close this gap.</li>



<li><strong>Provide upfront, comprehensive support:</strong> Move away from reimbursement models that force families to front fees. Scholarships should cover tuition and supplies before the semester starts. Even small hidden costs like photocopying certificates or paying for internet access can derail a poor student. Covering uniforms, travel, and exam fees up front ensures no one is left waiting or indebted.</li>



<li><strong>Bundle life skills and mentorship:</strong> Accompany funding with regular counseling, communication workshops, and peer mentorship. Smile Foundation encapsulates this by embedding scholarships in life-skills training in a language students understand. Such holistic care from teaching time management to providing psychosocial support boosts resilience.</li>



<li><strong>Prioritise girls and the most disadvantaged:</strong> Design eligibility criteria around socioeconomic need, not just grades. Scholarship programmes must explicitly counter gender and caste bias. Initiatives like Smile’s <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/donation/support-girl-child" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">She Can Fly</a></strong> recognise that for many families, sending a daughter to a distant college is a social challenge as much as a financial one. By including menstrual hygiene kits, counselling, and safe lodging in a girls’ scholarship package, one organisation can dramatically improve female retention.</li>



<li><strong>Partner with industry and education systems:</strong> Scholarships should be the bridge between school and the workplace. CSR funding can create scholarship seats tied to internships or apprenticeships. Colleges can work with employers to adapt curriculum and host career fairs. The NEP 2020 envisions incubation centres and vocational tracks in universities – donors can help build these bridges by funding projects, labs, and student exchange with industry.</li>



<li><strong>Track and share success:</strong> Document case studies of students who have thrived with holistic support. Anecdotes like Vaishnavi’s success are inspiring, but scaling best practices requires data. If governments and NGOs pool evidence on which combinations of support lead to graduation and jobs, we can replicate what works.</li>
</ul>



<p>Implementing such a model takes coordination, but the payoff is enormous. For donors and CSR heads, the message is clear: <strong>Invest in the whole student, not just the fees. </strong>A truly equitable higher education system will not emerge from fee waivers alone. It will be built by understanding students’ lives – their journeys, hurdles, and aspirations – and filling every gap along the way.</p>



<p>By closing gaps in both tuition and opportunity, holistic scholarships pave a fairer, more durable path to success. They ensure that a poor student not only gets in, but also moves forward. Only by redefining access in this way can India truly unleash the potential of its youth.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>India’s booming gig economy offers flexibility and opportunity, but millions of blue-collar workers remain trapped in low-paying, unstable roles due to limited skills and support. Smile Foundation’s upskilling initiatives focus on equipping these workers with digital literacy, vocational training, financial awareness, and life skills.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>India’s economic story is often told through the lens of innovation, startup growth, and digital disruption. But behind this dominant narrative lies the fact that millions of working Indians are underemployed, not unemployed. According to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, India’s underemployment score stands at 62.28, even though official unemployment remains below 7 percent.</p>



<p>The distinction matters. While unemployment refers to those without jobs, underemployment captures those working below their skill level or in insecure, low-paying roles. A large portion of these workers belong to India’s informal or gig economy. They drive cabs, deliver groceries, repair appliances, or assist in homes and hospitals. They are essential to daily urban life, but remain invisible in policy conversations. Without intervention, they risk being left behind in an economy that is moving faster than their ability to catch up.</p>



<p>The solution lies in reimagining <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" title="Livelihood" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2611" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">skill development</a>, especially for blue-collar gig workers. This is not about formal degrees or certificates, but about equipping people with the tools they need to succeed in the real economy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gig-economy-a-growing-workforce-with-shrinking-opportunities"><strong>Gig economy: A growing workforce with shrinking opportunities</strong></h2>



<p>India’s gig economy is expanding rapidly. Reports estimate that gig work could contribute up to <strong>1.25 percent of India’s GDP by 2030</strong>. Platform-based jobs now stretch across services from delivery and ride-hailing to beauty, domestic care and field tech support.</p>



<p>Yet most of these roles sit at the bottom of the value chain. They are transactional, poorly paid, and offer little upward mobility. More than 90 percent of India’s workforce is informally employed, and within that, a significant share are blue-collar gig workers with little to no social security.</p>



<p>A Bain &amp; Company study notes that only 12 percent of gig workers use platforms to grow their earnings or build businesses. A staggering 35 percent are financially strapped day labourers who survive on daily wages, making them particularly vulnerable to inflation, illness, or platform shutdowns.</p>



<p>The skills gap explains much of this stagnation. Gig work today is no longer just physical—it is digital and customer-facing. A delivery worker needs to manage orders through apps, handle cashless payments, communicate with customers and navigate real-time changes. These are not intuitive tasks, especially for first-time earners from rural or low-income urban households.</p>



<p>The problem is not a lack of aspiration. Most of these workers seek better lives, more stable incomes, and opportunities to grow. What they lack is access to the kind of skilling that prepares them for the future of work.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-limitations-of-current-skilling-programmes"><strong>The limitations of current skilling programmes</strong></h2>



<p>India has made considerable investments in skilling through schemes like <a href="https://skillindiamission.in/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Skill India Mission</a> and <a href="https://www.india.gov.in/pradhan-mantri-kaushal-vikas-yojana-pmkvy" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">PMKVY</a>. These programmes have helped formalise vocational training across sectors. But for gig workers, especially blue-collar ones, most skilling options remain out of reach.</p>



<p>First, traditional training centres often operate on fixed schedules and at fixed locations. Gig workers, with unpredictable shifts and long hours, cannot easily attend. Second, many programmes still teach generic skills like tailoring, data entry, beauty services without linking them to current market demand or platform-specific roles. Third, most workers receive little support after training. Placement services, mentorship, and access to finance are rarely integrated into the training lifecycle.</p>



<p>There is also a gender gap. Women in gig work, particularly in domestic or care roles, are rarely targeted for upskilling despite growing demand in <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2610" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> and home-based services. Digital safety, mobility constraints, and childcare responsibilities make it harder for them to access training.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-skilling-that-meets-workers-where-they-are"><strong>Skilling that meets workers where they are</strong></h2>



<p>For skill development to truly empower India’s gig workforce, it needs to adapt to the realities of blue-collar work. This means making training modular, mobile, vernacular, and hyper-local.</p>



<p>An effective skilling model for gig workers should include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Hands-on vocational training</strong> that mirrors real-world tasks</li>



<li><strong>Soft skills and life skills</strong> like communication, time management, and customer interaction</li>



<li><strong>Basic digital literacy</strong> to help navigate apps and online platforms</li>



<li><strong>Financial literacy</strong> to improve savings, budgeting, and credit access</li>



<li><strong>Entrepreneurial skills</strong> for those who want to build micro-enterprises or transition out of platform dependency</li>
</ul>



<p>These elements are not optional. They form the foundation of a future-ready, inclusive workforce that can adapt as platforms evolve and new jobs emerge.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smile-foundation-s-skilling-model-linking-training-to-livelihoods"><strong>Smile Foundation’s skilling model: Linking training to livelihoods</strong></h2>



<p>Smile Foundation’s work in the area of employability offers valuable insights into how blue-collar workers can be prepared for a modern economy. Through our <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Smile Twin e-Learning Programme (STeP)</a>, we provide market-linked training to youth aged 18 to 32 from underserved backgrounds. The curriculum focuses on retail, hospitality, logistics, beauty, and wellness—sectors where gig work is concentrated.</p>



<p>What sets STeP apart is its emphasis on end-to-end support. Participants are trained not just in job-specific skills but also in communication, basic English, financial literacy, and digital tools. The programme also partners with over 200 companies to ensure placement opportunities after training.</p>



<p>In 2023–24, more than 12,000 youth completed training through STeP. Of those, around 72 percent secured jobs in sectors aligned with their training, many in gig and service roles. The programme operates in 25 states, with a special focus on rural and tier-2 regions where formal skilling infrastructure is limited.</p>



<p>Beyond STeP, Smile Foundation collaborates with companies through <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" title="Corporate Partnerships" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2612" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">CSR</a> partnerships to reach larger numbers of gig workers. These partnerships fund mobile skilling vans, doorstep training and digital courses. This convergence of civil society implementation with corporate investment can accelerate change on the ground.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-corporate-engagement-not-just-good-csr-but-good-business"><strong>Corporate engagement: Not just good CSR, but good business</strong></h2>



<p>The private sector has a critical role to play in building a robust, inclusive gig economy. Better-skilled workers lead to better service delivery, improved customer satisfaction, and brand trust. In a competitive platform economy, quality, and reliability are key differentiators. Companies like Urban Company, Zomato, and Amazon are already experimenting with in-house training modules and health coverage for gig workers.</p>



<p>Others, like Quess Corp and Tata STRIVE, are running placement-linked skilling programmes that bridge the supply-demand gap in blue-collar services. Platforms that invest in upskilling their workers tend to have lower attrition and better ratings—benefits that directly affect their bottom line.</p>



<p>Government incentives could further encourage such investments. For example, public-private partnerships could tie skilling outcomes to tax credits or regulatory benefits. Micro-credentials co-designed by platforms and skilling partners can provide gig workers with verified, portable skills that enhance employability across platforms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-needs-to-happen-next-for-the-gig-economy"><strong>What needs to happen next</strong> <strong>for the gig economy</strong></h2>



<p>India’s demographic dividend will only pay off if its working-age population has the skills to meet 21st-century demands. For the blue-collar gig workforce, this requires a new approach that is agile, inclusive, and outcome-focused.</p>



<p>Here is what policymakers, nonprofits and corporate leaders can do:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Map sectoral needs</strong>: Regularly update demand forecasts for gig sectors and tailor skilling programmes accordingly.</li>



<li><strong>Encourage digital skilling</strong>: Make short-form, mobile-first learning content available in multiple Indian languages.</li>



<li><strong>Target women workers</strong>: Design training that includes mobility support, childcare solutions, and safe working conditions.</li>



<li><strong>Link training to finance</strong>: Combine skilling with access to microcredit, insurance and savings products.</li>



<li><strong>Certify and recognise skills</strong>: Create micro-credential systems that allow workers to build and stack skills over time.</li>



<li><strong>Strengthen local ecosystems</strong>: Build partnerships between municipalities, industry, and nonprofits to ensure local implementation and accountability.</li>
</ol>



<p>These steps require collaboration, not duplication. Skilling cannot succeed in silos. It must be embedded into public policy, supported by private innovation and delivered through grassroots networks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-looking-ahead-from-labour-to-leverage"><strong>Looking ahead: From labour to leverage</strong></h2>



<p>India’s gig economy is here to stay. It represents an opportunity to make the labour market more flexible, more inclusive, and more resilient. But without a concerted focus on upskilling, it could also deepen existing inequalities.</p>



<p>Blue-collar gig workers are not just labourers. They are caregivers, problem-solvers, and digital citizens in the making. When we invest in their growth, we invest in the very infrastructure that keeps our cities moving and our economy running.</p>



<p>A delivery worker today could become a team leader tomorrow, a home services provider could become a franchise owner, a ride-hailing driver could transition to fleet management. All this is possible if the right skills meet the right opportunity.</p>



<p>As India builds its future of work, the question is not whether gig work will grow, but whether gig workers will grow with it.</p>
