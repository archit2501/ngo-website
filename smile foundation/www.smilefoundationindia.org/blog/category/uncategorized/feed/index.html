<p><strong>In a world where you can be anything, Be Kind!</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Our world needs great leaders, writers, doctors, engineers, and lawyers. Why? So that they can work together to make the world a better place, without any wars. A world with long-lasting peace seems like a great place to be at.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It all starts from home and with primary caregivers– parents/guardians. Home is a child’s first school and parents/guardians are a child’s first teachers. So, parents need to give children a stress-free environment at home because it is necessary for overall growth. Growing up in such an environment will enable a child to choose love over hate, peace over war, compassion over anger, and friendship over conflict.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By war, we don’t necessarily mean a declared armed conflict between two nations. We are using the term ‘war’ here in an inclusive manner. War includes any conflict, such as riots, neighbor fighting, and children in school fighting. Even parents quarreling at home impacts children adversely.</p>



<p>However, we will discuss how to talk to children about war as well.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Stress?</strong> </h2>



<p>The UNICEF website says <a href="https://www.unicef.org/parenting/mental-health/what-is-stress#what-is-stress" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">stress</a> is a common feeling we get when we feel under pressure, overwhelmed, or unable to cope. Too much of it, especially when it feels out of control, can negatively impact our mood, physical and mental well-being, and relationships. Stress is a symptom, not a disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adults have ways to cope with stress. But children, when in distress, may act in ways that could harm themselves both emotionally and physically. So, parents, teachers, and guardians are expected to always be attentive to their ward&#8217;s needs and always look for signs their child is stressed and what is causing such stress.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>You Care, You See</strong>!</h2>



<p>You do not have to be a counselor, psychologist, or psychiatrist to notice the signs of stress. You just need to care a lot. A child may not be able to express her stress or what is causing it. When a child is small, they may not have the necessary vocabulary to show their stress. It is under these circumstances that one should look out for signs of stress. If you care enough, you will see the signs.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Stress could be Physical and Emotional</strong></h2>



<p>Physical symptoms of stress in children could be a headache, body pain, bed wetting, nausea, shallow beating, racing heart, weight loss or gain, indigestion, etc. These are easily noticeable visible signs. However, emotional distress in a child is not easily noticeable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emotional distress in children or mental stress signs could be anxiety, easily irritable, anger, tearfulness, sadness, and unwillingness to talk to family and friends. If you see such signs, then beware, that if not addressed properly a child may develop lifelong problems such as anxiety disorders, anger issues, trust issues, commitment issues, and a tendency to indulge in violent behaviors, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These stresses are the signs of an underlying problem. The cause of stress could be war or conflict, parents arguing/separation, bullying, school overload, inability to express themselves, financial problems, moving homes, death of loved ones, violent &amp; unsafe neighborhoods, using physical methods to discipline children or make them do stuff such as chores or homework, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to Help a Child in Distress?</strong></h2>



<p>There is no straight-jacket mantra to parenting. Each child is unique and has its own needs. However, there are three words for your kid to have a great childhood– <strong>Love, care, and safety</strong>.</p>



<p>A child lives with parents, meets relatives, goes to school, and interacts with teachers and friends. Each interaction and each step leaves a long-lasting impression on a child. Therefore, it is the duty of parents, teachers, relatives, and family members to care for the child they come to interact with.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously, parents love their kids. But the child needs to know it and feel it. Because more than anything else in this entire world a child needs to know that she is loved and cared for.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>There is No Formula Here</strong></h2>



<p>In our opinion, caring is helping. You need to listen to them and understand them. Never judge them. Talk to them. Empathy and sympathy are the keywords here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking out for what they are doing, and with whom they are interacting. Be part of their life, be friends with them. Know their likes and dislikes. Let them play games, outdoors or indoors. Take them on tours, trips, and camping. There is no formula here.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Your Conduct in Front of a Child</strong></h2>



<p>If the epics and myths are to be believed, then a child learns from the womb itself. After all, Abhimanyu of the great epic <em>Mahabharat </em>learned the art of breaking Chakravyuh, a formidable battle formation, because he could listen to that secret when his father, Arjuna of the <em>Pandavas </em>was telling his pregnant mother, Subhadra.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A child learns from every sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste. Parents are a child’s first role models. Do not indulge in any practice that might confuse their young brains. It may seem to be harmless but it is harmful in the long term.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your words, actions, and thoughts are not in harmony then a child will get confused, and this will cause stress.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Talk to Children about War</h2>



<p>A child in distress will take extreme steps, they will feel unsafe and confused. Some children may get mental <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="323" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> issues and others may choose violence to vent out their anger and frustration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If not addressed appropriately, these children have a heartbreaking chance to grow up to become aggressive adults who might choose war or violence to resolve problems rather than dialogue or diplomacy. This may seem far-fetched but a small sapling becomes a tree.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When a child falls or is injured by hitting a chair, table, or other stuff at home, they obviously cry. In such a situation a parent tells the child to hit back. A simple harmless way to make them stop crying. It is not that simple! It has deeper consequences. This teaches them retaliation. It teaches them that you can reduce their pain by taking revenge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, how to talk to children about war? War is one of the most intense subjects to take on with your child/children.</p>



<p>War is basically a failure of dialogue and understanding. It is an extreme step that is taken as a last resort– the result of impatience. In times of war or conflict, children are the worst affected because they really cannot understand what is going on around them. It confuses them. So, the following measures may be taken to the question of how to talk to children about war or conflict:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Limit Access to False Information&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Talk to your child. What ideas do they have about war? How does it affect them? Take care of what your child is reading and watching and seeing. This is how to talk to children about war. </p>



<p>In today’s age of information technology, access to the wrong kind of information is easily available, therefore, look out and limit it.&nbsp;This is a sensitive conversation that must be done naturally and in a playful manner. Remember you are not interrogating, do not make it a Q &amp; A session.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Know How They Feel</strong></h4>



<p>War may cause different reactions in different people. A child feels differently about it than an adult. Children learn from what they observe and experience. However, they may not interpret every situation as an adult does.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, a child who will see from a distance wrestling, as a sport, may interpret it as a violent fight. Therefore, we need to know and understand how a child feels and interprets war and conflict.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Understand Yourself First</strong></h4>



<p>War is a serious topic. Sometimes even adults may not have the right understanding of it. A war may perplex an adult as well, after all, the frequency of wars is more concentrated on some continents than others. So, educate yourself before talking to a child about it. Otherwise, you may aggravate their understanding of wars.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Keep it Simple and Easy&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>How to explain war to a child? The answer is, in the easiest, simplest, calmest, natural, and age-appropriate manner. Do not use big vocabulary or complex concepts.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Acts of Kindness and Compassion</strong></h4>



<p>In war times, people fight, but there are people who help others. Tell your children about such people that are doctors, nurses, peacekeepers, caretakers, etc. The stories of acts of kindness are strong and powerful enough to bring about a positive change in a child’s behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teach them to care. Quoting an <a href="https://www.gandhiashramsevagram.org/autobiography/chapter-9.php" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">extract</a> here from Mahatma Gandhi’s autobiography, <strong>My Experiments with truth</strong>, to throw light on the idea of returning good for evil done–&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“For a simple penny pay thou back with gold:</em></p>



<p><em>If thy life be rescued, life do not withhold.</em></p>



<p><em>Thus the words and actions of the wise regard;</em></p>



<p><em>Every little service tenfold they reward.</em></p>



<p><em>But the truly noble know all men as one,</em></p>



<p><em>And return with gladness good for evil done.”</em></p>
<cite>Mahatma Gandhi</cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Resort to the Power of Repetition&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>This is not a one-time thing. Children are impressionable. They learn and forget easily. So, keep talking to them, keep <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">educating </a>them, and keep loving them. Remind them often–</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“In a world where you can be anything, Be Kind!”</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It’s unfortunate that humans are threatening their own future. Today&#8217;s societies confront numerous challenges, including climate change and environmental crises, two looming issues in the world. </p>



<p>Undoubtedly, development is required to meet human needs and improve quality of life, but it should not be done at the cost of harming the natural environment. Let&#8217;s understand that harming the environment eventually harms humans, particularly future generations. </p>



<p>Sustainable&nbsp;development is&nbsp;based on the idea that sustainability protects both the interests of future generations and the earth&#8217;s capacity to rejuvenate itself. To ensure that future generations have access to sufficient resources, it is imperative that humans interact with the environment sustainably. </p>



<p>We need a transformation in <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1935" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> to ensure that everyone acquires the knowledge, competencies, and attitudes necessary to respond to&nbsp;urgent crises and work towards a sustainable future. Therefore, <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/unesco-urges-making-environmental-education-core-curriculum-component-all-countries-2025" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">UNESCO has set a new objective</a>&#8211; to make environmental education a core curriculum component in all nations by 2025.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Sustainable Education?</strong></h2>



<p>Sustainable education helps learners understand how human actions affect the environment, the current issues, and the need to respond and work towards a better future for everyone. It is an educational approach that emphasises the relationship between humans and the environment. </p>



<p>It aims to instil in students an awareness of environmental issues and the impact of human activity on the environment, and the knowledge and skills necessary to address these issues in a sustainable way. This also includes addressing the different needs of all individuals in existing and future communities, promoting individual wellness, social cohesion, and inclusion, and establishing equal opportunity.</p>



<p>Sustainable education is often interdisciplinary, drawing from various fields of study such as ecology, environmental science, economics, and social justice. It emphasises critical thinking, problem-solving, and hands-on learning to help students become effective environmental stewards.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why is Sustainable Education Important?</strong></h2>



<p>Sustainable education is important because it addresses the urgent need to promote sustainability in a world facing unprecedented environmental challenges. Climate change, biodiversity loss, and resource depletion are just some of the issues that threaten the future of our planet. </p>



<p>To address these challenges, we need to educate future generations on the importance of sustainability and provide them with positive impact tools.</p>



<p>In addition, sustainable education can help students develop a deeper understanding of their role in society and their responsibility to the environment. It can also promote social justice by addressing issues such as environmental racism and inequality. By teaching students about these issues, we can inspire them to become advocates for positive change and create a more equitable and sustainable world.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Integrating Sustainable Education in India&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>In India, which is home to seven of the world&#8217;s ten most polluted cities, the situation becomes even more dire. Water shortages are more prevalent than ever before. Although efforts are made toward sustainable development, they are largely <a href="https://india.un.org/en/sdgs" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">government-led</a> (clean energy, sustainable agriculture, etc.). </p>



<p>Now is the time for a collective mindset shift towards sustainable development and growth. Education plays a significant role in achieving this goal. Sustainable education needs integration into the curriculum in an interdisciplinary and comprehensive manner, allowing for an institution-wide approach to policy formulation.</p>



<p>Five ways how sustainable education can be integrated into the school curriculum–&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Introduce an&nbsp;Exclusive Citizenship Programme </strong></h4>



<p>taught throughout a child&#8217;s schooling. This programme teaches children their fundamental responsibilities and duties as citizens to improve their communities, the environment, and society. Children become global citizens and establish a foundation for their future development.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Encourage Project-based Learning </h4>



<p>that involves designing and implementing sustainable solutions. For example, students can work on projects that involve designing a sustainable garden or creating a composting system for the school.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Collaborate with Local Organizations and Community Groups </strong></h4>



<p>to provide opportunities for students to get involved in sustainability initiatives. This can include clean-up events, planting trees, or participating in sustainability workshops. The students can be immersed in real-world situations through field trips to reforestation programmes or factory floors.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Focus on social justice and equity</strong></h4>



<p>emphasizing the need for fair and equal access to resources and opportunities. This can help students understand the interconnectedness of social and environmental issues.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Model sustainable practices in school </strong></h4>



<p>by implementing green initiatives such as reducing waste, conserving energy, and promoting environmentally friendly transportation options. </p>



<p>Teachers make sure each class knows the materials they are using, where they come from, and the options available to reduce and rework their usage. This will help students see the real-world impact of sustainable practices and understand how to apply them in their own lives.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Looking Forward</strong></h2>



<p>Whether it be pollution or biodiversity loss, the current global environmental crisis has a particularly negative impact on children. To successfully secure a sustainable future for future generations, <a href="https://donate.smilefoundationindia.org/she-can-fly" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">we must educate and empower them</a> to design and implement solutions and collaborate with others to solve these problems. </p>



<p>Sustainable education plays a significant role in helping students think more critically about their choices in nearly every aspect of their lives.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smile Foundation and Education</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Smile Foundation</a> through its <a href="https://donate.smilefoundationindia.org/donate-for-education" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Shiksha Na Ruke</a> campaign is trying to make sustainable education possible for children. The initiative is bringing children from disadvantaged backgrounds back to schools after Covid-19 made it difficult for them to continue their education. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Change has been a constant feature of human experience on Earth. The world has evolved consistently through time, with the 21st witnessing arguably the quickest transformation of any age.</p>



<p>Thanks to technology, everything in our lives, from education to wellness, is on a rapid evolutionary path. It makes the future exciting, but we must also look back and repair the substantial collateral damage.</p>



<p>Childhood development is one of the areas exposed to circumstantial changes too. Children and teenagers of the 21st century face significant emotional, physical, and mental risks, despite the presence of cutting-edge technology at their fingertips.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Threats to Child Development</strong></h2>



<p>Children and teenagers today arguably face more challenging situations than their parents did at the same age. Climate change, marketing practices, and social media are the biggest factors, making teenagers getting affected physically and mentally.</p>



<p>Every society is equally responsible for protecting its young population. A <a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/world-failing-provide-children-healthy-life-and-climate-fit-their-future-who-unicef" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">2020 report</a> by a commission of over 40 child and adolescent health experts convened by the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, and The Lancet drew especially startling conclusions.</p>



<p>The findings warn the <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1025" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> and future of children and adolescents worldwide are under immediate threat. Ecological degradation, climate change, and exploitative marketing practices pushing the wrong foods and drinks are the key drivers of deteriorating health conditions of children, noted the report.</p>



<p>“Industry self-regulation has failed,” said Professor Anthony Costello, one of the Commission’s authors. “Studies in Australia, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, and the USA – among many others – have shown that self-regulation has not hampered commercial ability to advertise to children.”</p>



<p>“For example, despite the industry signing up to self-regulation in Australia, children and adolescent viewers were still exposed to 51 million alcohol ads during just one year of televised football, cricket, and rugby. And the reality could be much worse still: we have few facts and figures about the huge expansion of social media advertising and algorithms aimed at our children.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Role of Love in Childhood Development</strong></h2>



<p>Parents can do a great deal to protect their children’s mental and physical health. Paying attention to their interaction with technology and eating habits can prove helpful, but love remains the key.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2749336" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">2019 study</a> demonstrated adults with higher levels of positive childhood experiences had a lower risk of mental health issues and greater adult-reported social and emotional support.</p>



<p>The study concluded promotion of positive childhood experiences reduces the risk for teenage mental health support and adult relational health. Joint assessment of positive childhood experiences and adverse childhood experiences may enable a focus on building strengths to promote well-being.</p>



<p>Hence, parents must foster safe, stable relationships for children and build environments for positive experiences. A warm, loving family can reduce mental and physical health issues in children and have the following impact:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Children gain confidence, and it increases their self-esteem.</li>



<li>They can learn conflict resolution skills, which may prove useful in future professional relationships.</li>



<li>They learn about the importance of communication and social interactions.</li>



<li>They become healthier thanks to home-cooked healthy meals, regular exercise and play, and early bedtimes.</li>



<li>They become resilient and flexible enough to handle different situations.</li>



<li>They have a sense of stability and predictability due to their routine.</li>



<li>They do not need to push to feel loved. They have unconditional love.</li>
</ul>



<p>Parents can use some of their own experiences to determine how to build a loving space that helps their children grow comprehensively.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Promoting Family Love</strong></h2>



<p>It is clear from studies and life experiences that family love can make a difference in children’s mental and physical health. The right environment can take their minds off the misleading social media and television content, allowing them to focus on human relations.</p>



<p>There are several other ways as well in which parents can nurture family love and early childhood professional development. A few include:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Make Family Time a Priority</strong></h4>



<p>Working parents may find it tough to give due attention to their children. Parents must ensure they give their children adequate time when they’re home from work.</p>



<p>They must dedicate at least a couple of hours of family time and ensure their children have positive experiences. Making family time a priority can make children trust their parents, which can be helpful when they grow up and need someone to talk to.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Play Games and Sports Regularly</strong></h4>



<p>Games and sports have a way of building connections faster than anything else. Parents can use that to their advantage, playing regular games or sports with their kids.</p>



<p>They can dedicate a certain number of hours or specific days to play with their kids. It can help build better bonds, keep their children fresh and active, and sharpen their decision-making.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Listen</strong></h4>



<p>Parents have a lot to think about. Their minds are at 100 places at once, making it difficult to concentrate sometimes. It is especially true when they’re home.</p>



<p>As a result, they may not listen carefully to their children, leading to a lack of communication. If not mended, it can lead to serious disconnects that hamper teenage mental health and lead to bigger problems in the future.</p>



<p>Therefore, parents need to listen carefully to their children from a young age. Once home, they give their children undivided attention and understand what they want or need.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Talk More</strong></h4>



<p>In today’s day and age, as children age, they usually speak less directly to people and more through phones. It isn’t a healthy trait, and many teenage mental health crises arise due to reduced human interactions.</p>



<p>Using phones as the primary mode of conversation may even make teenagers and youngsters fearful of social events. Parents can prevent this by taking the initiative and talking more with their kids.</p>



<p>They must create an environment of open communication where kids can discuss anything they feel like.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Express Your Love</strong></h4>



<p>Actions are far more important than words. Teenagers would be happier if their parents expressed their love rather than saying it 50 times a day.</p>



<p>Fortunately, it doesn’t take a lot to express love. Parents can embrace their children or do something special for them to display their love.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Love in Friendship</strong></h2>



<p>Family love is critical to childhood development, but so is friendship. Children often make unconditional and deep bonds with their friends, some even lasting for a lifetime. Bonds formed in childhood are unique and can become a key part of an adult’s life.</p>



<p>Parents should promote friendship and ensure their children regularly interact with their friends in school or at home. It can improve children’s social interaction skills and make them a joy to be around.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Final Thoughts: Love and Childhood Development</strong></h2>



<p>Love is perhaps the most powerful emotion. It can bring immense joy, comfort, and a sense of belonging. It is vital for kids, with studies proving the profound impact of love from family and friends on a child&#8217;s health and well-being.</p>



<p>The need for love only increases with time as teenagers live in an age of limitless distractions and less care. Parents must prepare for it and find time to communicate or risk teenage mental and physical health issues.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has emerged as a powerful mechanism for driving social change. It allows companies to contribute meaningfully to society while funding crucial development projects in areas such as education, healthcare, rural infrastructure, and more.</p>



<p>While corporate philanthropy has long existed in India, CSR has formalized the process. Under the Companies Act, it is now mandatory for eligible businesses to allocate a portion of their profits towards social development initiatives. This framework ensures consistency, accountability, and broader impact.</p>



<p>One of CSR’s most significant contributions is that it has created opportunities for grassroots NGOs to access funding. These small but impactful organisations are now able to scale their work through partnerships with corporations. On the other side, companies benefit by engaging with trusted organisations that are deeply rooted in communities and equipped to implement effective programmes.</p>



<p>This ecosystem of strategic <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" title="Corporate Partnerships" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2559" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">CSR</a> partnerships ensures that social initiatives are implemented efficiently while also contributing to long-term business value.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-csr">What Is CSR?</h2>



<p>The full form of CSR is Corporate Social Responsibility. As <a href="https://www.unido.org/our-focus/advancing-economic-competitiveness/competitive-trade-capacities-and-corporate-responsibility/corporate-social-responsibility-market-integration/what-csr" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">defined</a> by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), CSR is “a management concept whereby companies integrate social and environmental concerns in their business operations and interactions with stakeholders.”</p>



<p>In simpler terms, it refers to a company’s commitment to balancing economic, environmental, and social goals—also known as the Triple Bottom Line approach.</p>



<p>While the concept of <a href="https://www.hec.edu/en/faculty-research/centers/society-organizations-institute/think/so-institute-executive-factsheets/what-corporate-social-responsability-csr" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">CSR began</a> evolving in the 1950s and 60s, it gained momentum globally in the 1990s and 2000s. According to a <a href="https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2017/10/kpmg-survey-of-corporate-responsibility-reporting-2017.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">2017 KPMG survey</a>, only 35% of the world’s largest 250 companies were reporting their CSR efforts in 1999. This number grew to 45% in 2002, 64% in 2005, and over 80% by 2008. From 2011 onwards, over 90% of these companies consistently report their CSR work.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">CSR in India: A Legal Mandate</h2>



<p>India became the <a href="https://www.csr.gov.in/content/csr/global/master/home/home.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">first country in the world to mandate CSR</a> through the Companies Act, 2013. The law requires qualifying companies to spend 2% of their average net profit on CSR activities each financial year.</p>



<p>Since this mandate came into effect, the impact has been remarkable. In FY 2020–21, over 18,000 Indian companies collectively spent more than ₹25,000 crore on CSR projects across 14 focus areas, including rural development, education, <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2558" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a>, environment, and more.</p>



<p>For businesses, CSR is not just about compliance. It is about giving back to the community they operate in and contributing to the social fabric that supports their success.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Role of Partnerships in CSR Success</h2>



<p>Effective CSR implementation depends heavily on collaborations with the right partners—be it NGOs, government bodies, or community-based organisations. While corporates may have the funds, they often lack the on-ground expertise to carry out large-scale development initiatives.</p>



<p>This is where partnerships become vital. For example, a company based in Mumbai can support flood relief efforts in rural Assam by partnering with a local NGO that understands the region’s specific needs. Similarly, CSR funds can support government programmes to amplify impact—such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, when several companies contributed to national healthcare and relief efforts.</p>



<p>When partnerships are aligned in purpose and values, the outcome is more impactful and far-reaching.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Moving Beyond CSR: Strengthening Implementation</h2>



<p>However, selecting the right partner is key. Corporates must conduct thorough due diligence to ensure that the funds they allocate are used transparently and effectively. Long-term partnerships, rather than short-term funding cycles, help drive deeper, more sustainable impact.</p>



<p>Organisations receiving CSR funds must also maintain ongoing communication and collaboration, aligning their goals and operations with corporate expectations. Meanwhile, companies should build robust monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) systems to track progress and measure outcomes.</p>



<p>As India’s corporate sector grows, so will its CSR contributions—unlocking the potential for transformational change. But this will only be possible if the funds are deployed efficiently through meaningful partnerships.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Way Forward</h2>



<p>CSR is more than compliance—it is a pathway to social equity, shared growth, and inclusive development. When companies collaborate with the right partners, they help create a society that is stronger, fairer, and better equipped for the future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Partnering for Impact: A Call to Action</h2>



<p>At Smile Foundation, we believe in building a more equitable world for all children. Since our inception, we’ve worked alongside corporations to drive impact through CSR—particularly for children and communities from low-income backgrounds.</p>



<p>We invite like-minded organisations to join us in creating lasting change through strategic CSR partnerships.</p>

<p>Who are geniuses? Are geniuses <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/geniuses-born-or-made/2012/05/28/gJQAkvRhxU_blog.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">born or made</a>? This oddball question has gained a lot of attention from humankind for a few centuries. The highly acclaimed movie <a href="http://theyorker.co.uk/film-and-tv/good-will-hunting-for-an-education-the-value-of-choice/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Good Will Hunting</a> portrayed how a janitor at MIT from a commonplace background can turn out to be a genius, even without a formal education. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Beyond The Genius&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>But what about those who work hard, come from no-privilege backgrounds, and need a formal <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2470" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> in the form of livelihood training to make it in the world? An <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/indias-unemployment-rate-increases-to-7-45-in-february/articleshow/98515291.cms" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">increase in unemployment</a> from 7.14% in January 2023 to 7.45% in February 2023 has shot up the number of unemployed people in India.</p>



<p>With the country making strong moves towards becoming a global super economy, it’s imperative that the Indian youth is prepared for the job market from the word &#8216;go&#8217;. </p>



<p>Ashar, a resident of Govandi (Deonar), Maharashtra, seemed shy in the beginning. In his world as an introvert, even interacting with people on a daily basis was a task. But when one meets their tribe, one becomes more expressive and interactive. That’s exactly what happened with Ashar Sayyed, our livelihood beneficiary.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ashar’s Strive&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/WhatsApp-Image-2023-03-08-at-4.12.43-PM-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-5302" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/WhatsApp-Image-2023-03-08-at-4.12.43-PM-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/WhatsApp-Image-2023-03-08-at-4.12.43-PM-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/WhatsApp-Image-2023-03-08-at-4.12.43-PM-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/WhatsApp-Image-2023-03-08-at-4.12.43-PM.jpeg 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ashar attending one of his BFSI classes</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ashar lost his father during the mayhem of COVID-19. As what happens with people of limited means; Ashar never concerned himself about getting therapy to resolve the trauma and emotional upheaval of losing a parent.</p>



<p>Instead, he started looking for job opportunities. Making money was a priority for Ashar.&nbsp;Professional therapy is expensive when all your efforts go towards securing an income for your family.</p>



<p>Ashar wanted to start contributing towards household expenses that included the educational expenses of his younger brother. His mother is a homemaker and his elder brother is a sales executive. His elder brother’s income was not enough for the whole house and its needs.  </p>



<p>Ashar promised himself to get a job that provided well for his family. The <a href="https://www.euronetworldwide.com/use-cases/days-of-caring-india/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Euronet livelihood programme</a> done in collaboration with Smile Foundation offered Ashar a perfect opportunity to make his dream come true.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Getting Enrolled Into Smile Foundation’s BFSI Course&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="766" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG-20230308-WA0012-1024x766.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5301" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG-20230308-WA0012-1024x766.jpg 1024w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG-20230308-WA0012-300x224.jpg 300w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG-20230308-WA0012-768x575.jpg 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG-20230308-WA0012.jpg 1160w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ashar completing his 4-month long BFSI course</figcaption></figure>



<p>He enrolled himself in the 4-month long BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance) course at Govandi center of Smile Foundation’s Euronet programme and became a livelihood beneficiary. He didn’t have to invest in his training financially and that was a&nbsp;big relief to him. </p>



<p>In his first few classes, he seemed nervous but he eventually became more comfortable with his classmates and faculty. Ashar started exhibiting youthful exuberance and confidence; something that made everyone at the center happy.</p>



<p>His soft skills, computer, banking, marketing, and core employability knowledge improved exponentially in the course of these 4 months. The faculty at the center was his guiding light. With the support of understanding counselors, Ashar was able to determine his goals and charter a path toward achieving them.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ashar Acing His Interview&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FurqjlUOzara-0pkCKibt8IUWBcoupxZDZ4Fx4IpZVKd55duQmPqL242_zCb3VQzHjJW3_L-D3Rjio8hIdyI7fke1bAKr65TJkWx3n-7V5r7YKovacZgh3OilFormn0rE_fpXng21bnT3t8cnQoC5g" alt="Ashar office pic" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ashar at his workplace</figcaption></figure>



<p>Our resilient one, Ashar was fully prepared for his interview rounds at the end of the 4-month long BFSI course. The faculty at the center was successful in helping Ashar live his dream. He got a great job as a sales executive at Sincetele Info. Solutions Ltd.- a company offering personal loans to its customers. With a monthly salary of INR 11,000, Ashar is standing on his own feet, determined to make it big.</p>



<p>Ashar might not be a genius but he is everything that all parents hope their children turn out to be– hardworking, kind, and ever-ready to learn new things in life. Ashar is doing justice to the multiple meanings of his name– Ashar is brave, lively, and accumulating all the needed wisdom in the world to keep going.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the epic <a href="https://hi.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A4" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Mahabharata</a>, the young prince Yudhishthira along with his Pandava brothers and their Kaurava cousins studied in a gurukul. Their legendary and illustrious teacher, Dronacharya asked all Pandavs and Kauravs to speak the truth. Then he asked each student to explain what they learned, everybody except Yudhisthir said the same thing “Always speak the truth and never tell a lie”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yudhishthira, the eldest among the five <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandava" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Pandava</a> brothers said that he had not yet learned the lesson. Everybody was surprised to hear the statement. Duryodhan and his Kaurava brothers mocked and taunted him for failing to learn such a simple lesson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After one week Yudhishthira said that now he has fully grasped the lesson of always speaking the truth and never a lie. He explained that he had lied in his thoughts and it gradually took him a complete week to get rid of all the lies in his thoughts. This is an example of young prince Yudhishthira’s reflective learning.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Reflective Learning?</strong></h2>



<p>Evaluating your learning process and behavior is a key component of reflective learning. It involves determining the steps in your process that works best, then deciding whether to repeat them or change them in some way. And that is what reflective learning stands for, in brief.</p>



<p>Innovation, ingenuity, and lifelong learning are now fundamental components of the academic curriculum due to changes in educational philosophy and curricula over the past few years. We have incorporated new technological tools into education, such as ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Learning Management Systems</a> (LMS).</p>



<p>These tools have made life easier for both teachers and students. In light of the shifting and ever-changing world, students must exercise creativity and actively participate in the learning process. Reflective learning is crucial if students are to analyse what they have learned and how they learned it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Impact and Importance of Reflective Learning</strong></h2>



<p>The development of a person requires reflective learning. It is beneficial for us to learn from our past experiences and errors in order to improve going forward. It is also a useful tool for life analysis and change.</p>



<p>Particularly for young people who are still learning about the world and how it operates, this development is crucial. Reflective learning enables people to make future decisions without being hurried or under pressure from others, which may cause them to take incorrect steps in their lives.</p>



<p>Because they have taken the time to consider what they want out of life and what they need to do to get it, people who consistently practise reflective learning tend to be more successful than those who don&#8217;t. Thinking in this way prompts immediate action, which ultimately propels people toward their idea of success.</p>



<p>One-track lectures aren’t looked forward to by both students and teachers. What works best is when students can provide helpful feedback to teachers by expressing their ideas or making suggestions in their reflective learning diaries.</p>



<p>Students are substantially more likely to understand complex subjects if they actively engage in their studies. Because they are contributing, they feel as though they have a say in how they are learning.</p>



<p>The rhythm of the lesson, for instance, needs to shift from week to week. Instead of trying to remember what was accomplished in a previous lesson, why not consider using mind mapping or brainstorming sessions?</p>



<p>While working in small groups, the students are able to employ unique and imaginative presentation strategies. Each student or group is able to provide input, talk about concepts and ask questions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Engagement</strong></h2>



<p>The educational landscape is evolving. In the past, teachers would instruct students to memorise facts and statistics so they could recite them verbatim on a test. Teachers are putting more of an emphasis now on getting students involved in active learning, encouraging them to think critically about their surroundings and connect what they learn in class to their lives outside of school.</p>



<p>Involving students in reflective practice leads to improved learning results compared to conventional teaching techniques. Additionally, it raises student engagement by encouraging active participation in class debates and presentations and increasing their level of commitment to their academic endeavours.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Enhances Memory</strong></h2>



<p>One method for enhancing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_and_retention_in_learning" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">memory retention</a> is reflective learning. The information must be divided into manageable chunks, and each chunk must be practised repeatedly until it is memorised. You need to be aware of what you&#8217;re doing and how it feels when you learn anything new.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Repeated practice helps to create neural connections in the brain, making it easier for the brain to recall the information later on when you need to access it. Anyone who wishes to enhance their life or work can employ reflective learning; it is not just for students.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you employ reflective learning, you can take a critical look at your past actions and use that knowledge to alter how you approach problems in the future. Thinking in this way enables us to develop as humans and fortifies our identities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fosters Integration</strong></h2>



<p>This approach to education puts an emphasis on reflective problem-solving and critical thinking. Instead of just having students memorise information, the objective is to educate them on how to learn from their mistakes.</p>



<p>The widespread use of the Internet has made it simpler than ever for both teachers and students to go at their own pace. Many teachers have discovered that this unique method of learning boosts self-esteem while simultaneously enhancing retention rates and academic performance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Creative Thinking</strong></h2>



<p>By assisting students in integrating their knowledge and experiences, reflective learning can promote creativity.</p>



<p>Reflective learning is crucial to the development of creative thinking because it enables students to synthesise the data they have gathered and draw connections between various areas of expertise. A learner can organise their ideas into meaningful patterns that change how they view the subject matter when they reflect on what they have learned from a particular experience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Aid Teachers in Understanding the Needs of Students</strong></h2>



<p>Knowing what your students need is the first step in knowing how to assist them.</p>



<p>When it comes to teaching, it&#8217;s not enough to simply cover the information. You must understand the different learning styles of your students in order to provide them with the greatest learning support possible.</p>



<p>For educators, reflective teaching is a fantastic technique to learn this information. It aids educators in comprehending both their own and the learning preferences of students. In order to make the necessary corrections, it also enables them to recognise the advantages and disadvantages of their chosen teaching methods or curriculum.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reflective Teaching to Reflect On Your Capabilities&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Reflective learning gives pupils the chance to consider their skills. It enables students to sit back, reflect on what they have learned, and determine how they may develop their talents. As a result of the high level of self-awareness required for this form of learning, the learner may become more motivated and grow.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Facilitating Reflective Learning in Higher Education: An Activity</strong></h2>



<p>While journaling offers similar learning opportunities, blogging as a reflective practice encourages the creation of content meant for public consumption. As students must closely examine what they publish, how it is conveyed, and how to title or frame the blog entry, blogging about a particular subject can be a great way to encourage the growth of communication abilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asking students to take charge of a blog, update it frequently, and respond to comments left by their peers fosters self-regulation and promotes self-learning. Consider giving students a topic they learned about in a particular week to further study on their own time before using a blog tool to write a blog article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Successful blog assignments need students to back up their assertions and arguments with evidence, use concrete examples to clarify concepts, and reflect on the material in order to make their articles more relatable and personable. Ask students to post to their blogs on a regular basis, then utilise the content to spark debates in class and inspire lectures. Asking students to follow well-known bloggers in their profession can also be a really helpful way to help them understand the basics of blogs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What sticks, just sticks!</strong></h2>



<p>Any learning technique that helps knowledge stick in your brain is the finest one. You can identify your educational goals through reflection. You gain a deeper understanding of who you are and how learning fits into your life by doing this.</p>



<p>Additionally, it aids in directing decisions made at each level of the procedure, including selecting courses, deciding on a major, reviewing your progress, and making future plans. That can assist students in staying on course to achieve their academic objectives, regardless of how &#8216;off the beaten path&#8217; the path may be.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>The future of education is digital. We need to prepare our students for a world where technology is omnipresent. </em></p>
<cite>Susan Wojcicki (A Polish-American business executive who was the CEO of YouTube from 2014 to 2023)</cite></blockquote>



<p>As a student, you might remember sitting in a classroom listening to teachers giving lectures about different subjects, and taking notes with a pen and paper. If we had a question, we raised our hands and waited for the teachers to respond to our queries. The most high-tech tool in the room was a chalkboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fast forward to today, and the classroom looks very different. Students are using laptops or tablets to take notes and complete assignments. Teachers are incorporating virtual reality experiences and interactive whiteboards into their lessons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic forcing many schools to adopt remote learning, education has become even more technology-driven. Video conferencing and online learning platforms became the norm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These changes are just a few examples of the education trends that have emerged over the past few decades. As technology advances and society evolves, so does the way we approach education. Here we&#8217;ll explore some of the most important education trends 2023. We will try to understand what they mean for students, teachers, and society as a whole.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>&#8220;Artificial Intelligence has the potential to transform education by providing personalized learning experiences, improving access to education, and bridging the knowledge gap. However, we must ensure that AI is adopted in a fair and equitable manner, with the ultimate goal of reducing, rather than reinforcing, existing inequalities in education.&#8221; </em></p>
<cite>Audrey Azoulay, Director-General of UNESCO</cite></blockquote>



<p>The impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been revolutionary across various fields, including education. Virtual assistants and tutoring systems are increasingly being used in classrooms to help students and teachers manage time, complete assignments, and deliver personalized learning experiences to learners of all ages and abilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Online and remote learning systems also use AI to adjust the pace of teaching and cater to individual student needs. Furthermore, language translation technology is being utilized in educational settings where multiple languages are spoken. Some schools in China have even started using facial recognition technology to monitor student engagement in class. This surely indicates the rise of education trends 2023.</p>



<p>UNESCO acknowledges that AI has the potential to address some of the most pressing challenges facing the education sector today. These include bridging the gap in access to quality education and improving knowledge–sharing worldwide. However, AI implementation also poses its own set of challenges, such as ensuring a fair and equitable rollout of this highly disruptive technology, which doesn&#8217;t exacerbate existing inequalities in the education system.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Remote, Digital and Personalized Learning</strong></h2>



<p>Prior to the global Covid-19 pandemic, the popularity of massive online open courses (MOOCs) was already transforming the landscape of online learning. However, due to the pandemic, schools, universities, and course providers were forced to quickly adapt to deliver education remotely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remote and online learning has become a means of reaching students who live in isolated or rural communities, providing them with access to education that they might not otherwise have had. This has the potential to greatly advance equality of educational opportunity, particularly in light of the fact that millions of children around the world do not attend school due to living in remote areas.</p>



<p>Personalised learning is a successful and innovative approach to education. It tailors teaching to the unique strengths, needs, talents, and interests of each student. This means creating an individual learning plan that is specific to the learner. The concept behind this approach is that every student has a different learning style and pace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With personalised learning, each student receives a customised plan based on their prior knowledge, abilities, and interests. This approach moves away from the traditional &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; philosophy often seen in schools. To ensure that students have a hands-on learning experience, the plan is project-based and designed to help them learn as they progress through their education. </p>



<p>This is one of the most hopeful of the education trends 2023.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality</strong></h2>



<p>The use of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) in education is becoming increasingly prevalent. VR enables users to enter a virtual world, with numerous experiences available ranging from historical recreations to hazardous environment training. In 2023, <a href="https://youthincmag.com/education-through-metaverse-welcoming-the-unimagined" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">virtual classrooms</a> and experiential learning will become more popular. </p>



<p>VR already finds use in healthcare training for various purposes, such as training nursing students to provide emergency care and teaching doctors surgical procedures.</p>



<p>Augmented reality (AR) is different from virtual reality (VR) as it overlays computer-generated images onto the real world that the user is seeing through a device such as a phone or a headset. The advantage is that it can provide real-time information, like warning a trainee about dangerous machinery in a manufacturing environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thebookseller.com/news/cambridge-university-press--assessment-partners-with-augmented-reality-publishing-company-ludenso" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">AR textbooks</a> are also available, containing images and models that come to life when viewed through a smartphone camera. This provides students with an in-depth understanding of various subjects. AR is also being used by museums and other educational sites to create more immersive learning experiences for visitors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>College Courses Not Enough</strong></h2>



<p>In the year 2023, high schools will dedicate more resources to prepare students for career paths beyond traditional college courses. This will result in the growing popularity of vocational and technical courses that teach diverse skill sets. Schools will collaborate with employers to find new solutions to tackle the problem of the skills gap.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the US, a significant number of high school graduates enroll in college courses, but school resources primarily focus on preparing this minority group. On the other hand, the emphasis on preparing students for non-traditional pathways, such as apprenticeships or on-the-job training needs more focus.</p>



<p>As the job market demands a workforce with the necessary skills, schools will shift their focus toward vocational education and training alongside traditional academic, subject-based training. In Europe, 2023 is designated as the European Year of Skills to recognize the importance of vocational education and training in developing new drivers of economic growth during a global slowdown or recession.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>&#8220;The future of the economy is in skill specialization. Technical schools and vocational training will be more valuable than an Ivy League degree. Because if you have a specific skill, you&#8217;ll always be employable.&#8221; </em></p>
<cite>Naval Ravikant (An Indian-American entrepreneur and investor. He is the co-founder, chairman, and former CEO of AngelList)</cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) and Soft Skills</strong></h2>



<p>Soft skills refer to human skills such as communication, teamwork, problem-solving, and conflict resolution that are unlikely to be replaced by machines. As AI takes on more technical responsibilities, these skills will become increasingly important and will be taught alongside technical education.&nbsp;</p>



<p>HR experts believe that while soft skills are essential to company success, they are harder to measure than hard skills such as math and programming. In 2023, STEM education will place more emphasis on these skills, and there will be increased efforts to measure and assess them within organizations.</p>



<p>In 2023, India&#8217;s National Education Policy (NEP) will drive significant educational reforms, with a focus on STEM-based learning and skill-based education. Policy developments aim at promoting digital literacy and providing equitable access to quality learning methods. As experiential learning gains popularity, school curriculums will undergo significant changes. The greater emphasis is on making learning enjoyable through innovative programs.</p>



<p>STEM as one of the most progressive education trends 2023 is not only about imparting knowledge, it&#8217;s about inspiring the next generation of innovators, problem-solvers, and creators who will lead us toward a better and brighter future.</p>

<p>The second last day of December 2022 was supposed to be a regular day for the Sonbhadra team of Smile Foundation&#8217;s Healthcare programme, <strong><em><a href="https://donate.smilefoundationindia.org/health-cannot-wait" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Health Cannot Wait</a></em></strong> but a healthcare case study caught the team by surprise. The team was performing its usual Outpatient Department (OPD) duties at Lahuwa under Nagwa block in Sonbhadra district, Uttar Pradesh.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Healthcare Case Study</strong></h2>



<p>The Auxiliary Nurse and Midwife (ANM), Runa Praveen informed the Community Health Officer (CHO), Seraj Ahmed about an old woman aged between 60-65 years severely burnt below her abdominal area a few days back. The woman was lying in the bed for more than one week without burn treatment. </p>



<p>Her family was not sure of the necessary next steps to treat the injuries of the woman. The ANM informed the team that maggots were growing inside the wound making the injured person feel restless. The presence of maggots in the wound was inflicting severe pain on the woman.</p>



<p><br>There woman has many family members but everyone was hesitant to do anything constructive to improve the grave situation. This healthcare case study was a bit baffling for the team. Mindset change was the biggest challenge in channelizing the family resources for the treatment of the severely burnt person. </p>



<p>The injured person was not a direct beneficiary of the Smile On Wheels arm of the <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="333" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Health</a> programme. However, she would come to the OPD  along with her daughter-in-law who needed regular medical treatment. The daughter-in-law received medicines when she got her checkups done at the OPD.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mobilize Local Leadership</strong></h2>



<p>Sonbhadra Smile Team arranged for a quick meeting to support the injured woman but the big question was: &#8220;What to do exactly?&#8221;. Her family members were not taking much interest in the case. They were not understanding the severity of the situation that the woman was in. </p>



<p>After a brief discussion internally, the team decided to involve the influence of local leadership to ensure proper treatment for the woman. We discussed in detail the whole matter with an influential person in the area and requested the person to intervene on behalf of the woman who needed immediate medical treatment.</p>



<p>The team of Smile Sonbhadra and the local leader discussed the matter with the family members of the injured old woman and successfully transformed their resistance into acceptance of the situation. The team not only managed to shift the injured woman to the district hospital but also ensured that the family members of the patient were the ones who made the call to the Ambulance Service. </p>



<p>The whole of the family came together with the injured woman&#8217;s daughter-in-law accompanying the ambulance and other family members ready to stay with her till the completion of the treatment process in the hospital.  </p>



<p>The whole episode came to an end within an hour. Simple, effective efforts based on humane values ensured the proper treatment of the person in need and upheld her right to a dignified life.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Current Status</strong></h2>



<p>The team of Smile Sonbhadra contacted the Accredited Social Health Activist&nbsp;(ASHA) of that village and enquired about the injured person&#8217;s condition. She informed the team that the patient was recovering well and her family members were present with her at the district hospital.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Healthcare Case Study: CHO Reflections</strong></h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Aged people lack in ability to perform household work/other work and therefore, some families consider them a burden</li>



<li>Social norms and values at constant threat; community-centric thinking needs to take center-stage</li>



<li>Family values dwindling </li>



<li>Shortage of people who can positively engage in such situations</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smile Foundation and Healthcare</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Smile Foundation</a> believes that healthcare must reach those who are traditionally cut off from nearby medical infrastructure. Healthcare should reach those for whom healthcare is a luxury that everyone cannot afford most times. We are working in a consistent manner to make the dream of <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/healthcare-for-all-reaching-the-unreachable/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">healthcare for all</a> a reality.</p>
