										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>India’s villages are bursting with youthful promise, but chronic infrastructure gaps keep many rural children in the dark—literally and figuratively. A recent Parliamentary report notes that only about 56.5% of government schools have electricity. This leaves nearly half of rural learners studying by daylight or kerosene lamp, cut off from the <strong>smart education </strong>the world now offers. </p>



<p>Government data show that barely 57% of schools even have computers and 54% have any Internet access. The result is inequality in urban and rural space. For example, in Delhi a vast majority of schools are digitally equipped, but in Bihar only 18.5% have Internet. In this setting, blending solar-powered infrastructure and digital classrooms can be a game-changer enabling round-the-clock electricity and internet even off the grid. </p>



<p>One Smile Foundation case study reports, in Odisha’s remote Kalahandi district schools once lacking desks and often even teachers have been transformed under Digital India. Today they boast <strong>internet connectivity, smart boards, and e-learning platforms</strong>. Lessons that once felt abstract now come alive on screens. These quiet revolutions show how renewable-energy upgrades and EdTech can leapfrog rural schools over decades of neglect.</p>



<p>Solar classrooms are more than a modern convenience. They are vital green infrastructure for the future. A 2022 expert study of Madhya Pradesh’s Harda district found that electrifying four rural schools and <em>anganwadis </em>with rooftop solar (and simple battery backups) boosted student attendance and enabled evening study sessions. Children could finally use smart classes, computers and the internet once there was light. Measured outcomes were impressive. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="724" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Electricity-1024x724.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14222" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Electricity-1024x724.jpg 1024w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Electricity-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Electricity-768x543.jpg 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Electricity-1536x1086.jpg 1536w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Electricity-1200x848.jpg 1200w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Electricity-1980x1400.jpg 1980w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Electricity.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Over a year the PV systems generated ~2,250 kWh of clean energy, saved ₹18,000 in utility costs, cut carbon emissions by 47 tonnes (equivalent to planting 74 mature teak trees), and unlocked water-pumping for clean drinking water. In the words of the implementers, the quality of light from electricity, often LEDs, is much better and more efficient, directly improving learning conditions. Such results echo global evidence. UNESCO’s new <strong>Green School Quality Standard</strong> explicitly calls for solar panels to provide a reliable energy source during electrical blackouts and drive climate action in schools.</p>



<p>Together, solar roofs and digital classrooms form a powerful green infrastructure  ecosystem. Solar panels on school roofs provide clean, off-grid power for ICT labs, water pumps, and safe lights. Classrooms become living labs where children literally plug into sustainability. Smile Foundation has facilitated solar panel installations in several partner education centres across nine states. These panels not only save energy costs, they are teaching tools with students learning first hand how renewable energy works and why it matters. The result is improved schooling today and a generation fluent in climate resilience. </p>



<p>As one Smile-backed <strong>Smart Classroom </strong>project found, solarisation plus tablets and interactive boards made learning interactive, engaging, and empowering in places long marked by deprivation. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="653" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-151214-1024x653.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14105" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-151214-1024x653.png 1024w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-151214-300x191.png 300w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-151214-768x490.png 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-151214-1536x979.png 1536w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-151214-1200x765.png 1200w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-151214.png 1545w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Critically, these green education initiatives align with India’s development schemes and global goals. The Union Government’s <em><strong>Samagra Shiksha</strong> </em>programme (the integrated school education scheme) now explicitly lets states use school electricity budgets to invest in solar/hybrid systems to ensure sustainability. Likewise, flagship campaigns like <strong>Digital India</strong> and the National Education Policy 2020 call for 24×7 schooling facilities and universal connectivity, which require steady power. </p>



<p>On the global front, UNESCO’s Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) agenda and the Greening Education Partnership stress climate-informed pedagogy and school infrastructure. UNESCO highlights that schools must walk the talk by greening learning environments. In fact, the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development ties these threads neatly. SDG&nbsp;4 (quality education) and SDG&nbsp;7 (affordable clean energy) intersect in solar classrooms, while SDG&nbsp;13 (climate action) is advanced when students adopt renewable power. Smile Foundation’s work is a microcosm of this synergy. Our projects are mapped to multiple SDGs, and indeed they now <strong>benefit 75,000+ students across 500+ schools</strong> in 9 states with these green-learning investments.</p>



<p><strong>Smile Foundation </strong>has long championed rural education and gender equity. In recent years, we have brought solar and digital tech to the fore. Our <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Mission Education</a></strong> centres now include <strong>Smart Classrooms</strong> equipped with projectors, tablets, and offline e-content – all powered by rooftop solar. This has <strong>enriched learning</strong> for thousands of underserved children. </p>



<p>For example, in 2024 Smile and partners installed solar-powered digital classrooms in government schools across <strong>Assam, Meghalaya, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Haryana</strong>. These six states were chosen specifically for their high need of both electrification and digital access. By incorporating solar energy, the project emphasises sustainable practices within the educational sector while fostering an atmosphere conducive to 21st-century learning. Students no longer struggle with power cuts or mobile blackouts; instead, they use laptops and projectors every day.</p>



<p>The outcomes are measurable and inspiring. Smile reports that its tech upgrades have directly impacted <strong>75,000 children</strong> <strong>in 2024</strong>, turning classrooms into hubs of climate action. Teachers now integrate interactive climate content into all subjects. Students at a Smile centre designed water rockets and roller coasters to learn physics, linking science to sustainability. Girls in these programmes are especially empowered. </p>



<p>Earlier girls’ education campaigns (<strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/donation/support-girl-child" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">She Can Fly</a></strong>) and career fairs have built momentum, and now girls in rural classrooms actively engage with digital learning and STEM through Smile’s OJT and STEM labs. Parents and community elders also notice a change. In places with solar classrooms, villagers report longer school hours, higher attendance, and a revived respect for education. Children who previously trudged home after noon now stay back for evening classes under electric lights, boosting study time and retention. In tribal Harda district, officials saw attendance rise immediately after panels went up with energy access driving higher enrolment and retention in school.</p>



<p>Quantitative gains are evident in learning metrics too. After technology interventions, tests scores and digital literacy jump. One study by Smile’s team showed rural students exposed to tablets and e-lessons bridged about 60-70% of the learning gap compared to urban peers, particularly in maths and English. Computer education classes, once rare in small schools, are now routine. Perhaps most telling, Smile reports that anecdotally girls’s participation in STEM doubled in schools with solar-powered labs (from 20% to over 45% of STEM club members). Young women on the solar-team become role models, saying if these panels can power our classroom, surely I can power my future.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-policy-and-partnership-levers"><strong>Policy and partnership levers</strong></h4>



<p>These on-the-ground results didn’t happen by accident. We leveraged multiple policy and funding streams. Samagra Shiksha has earmarked funds for ICT labs and even suggests solar in the recurring budget. The <strong>Digital India</strong> and <strong>PM eVidya</strong> campaigns, launched during Covid, have built nationwide e-learning content (DIKSHA, SWAYAM, etc.) but their impact depends on power.</p>



<p>Clearly, electrification and solar schemes must align with education budgets. Initiatives like <strong>Saubhagya</strong> (universal household electrification) and <strong>PM-KUSUM</strong> (solar pumps for farmers) exemplify the government’s rural solar push; extending similar focus to schools is logical. In fact, MPs on the HRD Committee have urged a <strong>Green Schools Fund </strong>to install solar everywhere.</p>



<p>Beyond government, corporate <a class="wpil_keyword_link" title="Corporate Partnerships" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2626" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">CSR</a> is a huge enabler. India’s Companies Act mandates ~2% of profits go to CSR. Many corporations now target that money at education and sustainability. We have successfully partnered with firms to our education programme to fund tech labs and solar kits. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-climate-resilient-impact"><strong>Climate-resilient impact</strong></h4>



<p>Importantly, solarised schools promote more than literacy; they build climate resilience. Rural areas face increasing heatwaves and storms – governments and UNESCO urge adaptation in education. UNESCO’s Green Schools framework even calls for flood-resistant classrooms and reliable off-grid power. Solar roofs, rainwater harvesting, and shade trees become part of green infrastructure on campus.</p>



<p>When Smile students plant native saplings and monitor their survival, they live SDG&nbsp;13 by converting learning spaces into <strong>green belts</strong> around school. One Smile tree-planting initiative in Maharashtra engaged 2,000 kids in planting 30,000 saplings – these not only sequester carbon but teach stewardship. Such projects forge a virtuous cycle: greener campuses reduce heat inside classrooms and lower energy needs. And with solar panels, a school’s carbon footprint plummets – as the Harda case shows, just a few panels offset tens of tonnes of CO₂.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-data-shows"><strong>What the data shows</strong></h4>



<p>Multiple surveys underscore these benefits. The UDISE+ (national school census) data cited by Smile reveal that millions of Indian children lack access to even basic digital infrastructure. But recent upticks are promising. For example, Education For All in India’s analysis of UDISE 2021–22 found that in some states like Uttar Pradesh solar adoption is rising (8.8% of schools had panels, up sharply in aided vs. govt schools), though many states still lag (e.g. only 3–4% in WB or Assam). This means huge potential remains untapped. Every percentage point of schools solarised could reach hundreds of thousands of students. Modeling studies show that increasing solar in schools directly correlates with improved learning outcomes. For instance, UDISE data cited in research suggest that schools with reliable lighting see 10–15% higher enrolment and exam pass rates compared to dark schools.</p>



<p>Another key metric is digital literacy. India’s National ICT Literacy Index (2023) shows rural-urban gaps of 20 percentage points, with girls trailing boys by 10 points in connectivity. In Smile-supported villages, mobile-computer literacy camps have pushed up women’s digital skills by ~30%. Anecdotally, girls in solar classrooms report newfound confidence: one 14-year-old girl from Jharkhand said, “I can now use a laptop confidently to help my siblings with homework without fear of grid failure.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-scaling-up-with-policy-action"><strong>Scaling up with policy action</strong></h4>



<p>To ensure every child benefits, we need smarter policy coordination:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Integrate Solar into All School Schemes:</strong> Samagra Shiksha and state education budgets should mandate solar kits as part of new school buildings and retrofits, just as they mandate toilets and ramps. States can issue dedicated guidelines (like the clause in Samagra allowing solar for sustainability). The Centre could create a <strong>Solar Schools</strong> component in national programmes, similar to how smart classrooms were funded.</li>



<li><strong>Link Education and Energy Planning:</strong> Renewable-energy schemes (PM-KUSUM, rooftop solar missions) should explicitly include schools and <em>Anganwadis </em>as priority installations. For example, Rural Development funds or CSR solar pumps might co-finance schools’ microgrids. Similarly, rural electrification efforts (e.g. Saubhagya or BharatNet connectivity) should be coordinated with Samagra districts, ensuring simultaneous rollout of power, net, and smart-boards.</li>



<li><strong>Finance via CSR and Philanthropy:</strong> The government can incentivise greater CSR in this sector by recognising climate-and-education projects as doubly impactful. Tax breaks or matching grants could reward companies that fund solar-education collabs. Impact bonds and blended finance could also be used. For instance, a green bond for rural education infrastructure, with pay outs tied to metrics like enrolment or test scores.</li>



<li><strong>Cross-Sector Partnerships:</strong> NGOs, corporates, and local governments must co-design solutions. Smile’s digital-cum-solar classroom in Haryana, done with state education officers’ buy-in, is a model. National bodies (like the NITI Aayog’s Atal Innovation Mission or the CSR Research Foundation) could convene task forces to replicate best practices across states. Teacher-training institutes should include modules on using solar/ICT tools. Universities (like IITs) could donate expertise in low-cost solar tech for schools.</li>



<li><strong>Promote Climate Education:</strong> The curriculum itself should reflect this infrastructure. If a school has solar panels, students should use them as teaching aids in math and science. Textbooks and online courses must highlight renewable tech projects happening locally. UNESCO’s <strong>Education for Sustainable Development</strong> framework emphasises learning by doing – school solar projects are tailor-made for such pedagogy.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-challenges-and-sustainability"><strong>Challenges and sustainability</strong></h2>



<p>Of course, hurdles remain. Maintenance of solar kits, digital hardware, and connectivity can be tricky in remote areas. Govt schools often lack IT technicians, and panels require periodic cleaning. Here too, solutions exist. Solar vendors now often offer 5-year maintenance contracts. Rural youth clubs can be trained (perhaps under the “Skill India” umbrella) to service school systems, creating local jobs. Internet backhaul can piggyback on village panchayat networks or BharatNet. Importantly, communities must co-own these assets. Smile’s model involves School Management Committees in each phase, ensuring parents and local leaders invest in upkeep.</p>



<p>Financially, the long-term gains justify the costs. Solar installations have a 10–15 year payback from bill savings. Economic analyses show that every rupee invested in rural education yields ~₹4–5 in lifetime economic benefits from higher productivity. With green infrastructure, the environmental externalities (avoided pollution, climate resilience) stack on top. Thus multilateral agencies like the World Bank and ADB are increasingly funding “green schools”. India should tap such funds and align them with domestic CSR/ADB projects (note ADB’s own support for off-grid solar schools).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-equity-through-green-education"><strong>Equity through green education</strong></h2>



<p>In the 21st century, <strong>green infrastructure</strong> is as essential to education as desks and books. Solar-powered digital classrooms embody a perfect synergy. They deliver electricity, clean energy, and global knowledge to doorstep villages. By merging renewable energy and EdTech, India can ensure that being born in a far-flung panchayat no longer means a second-tier schooling. Instead, it can be a stepping stone in the <strong>Equitable, Sustainable Education</strong> envisioned by the SDGs.</p>



<p>Smile Foundation experience shows it’s doable. Hundreds of schools across nine states, thousands of lives changed, and children inspired to be “eco-warriors”. Now, the task is to scale up rapidly through policy, partnerships, and funding. By embedding solar into every rural school and coupling it with quality digital content, India advances toward <em>Samagra Shiksha</em> for real – not just brick-and-mortar, but a full spectrum of facilities. This cross-sector approach – government norms, private CSR, civil-society innovation – can finally make electricity and internet as commonplace in rural India’s classrooms as pencils and notebooks. In doing so, we do more than light up blackboards. We ignite young minds to become the <strong>green leaders</strong> India needs.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Access to higher education in India remains deeply unequal, especially for students from low-income, rural, or marginalised communities. While financial aid is critical, it’s not enough. Smile Foundation’s holistic scholarship model goes beyond tuition, offering life skills, mentorship, digital training, and career guidance. This approach ensures students enter college and thrive, graduate, and build meaningful careers transforming individual lives, and families and entire communities across India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>India’s higher education expansion belies that access remains deeply unequal. Despite dramatic growth in colleges and universities, only a fraction of students make it to campus. The latest government data shows that a staggering <a href="https://education.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/higher-education/the-power-of-personalised-scholarships-in-shaping-indias-future/115521316#:~:text=Primary%20and%20secondary%20school%20enrolments,to%20college%2C%20according%20to%20AISHE" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">71.6% of Indian youth</a> do not progress from high school to college. This means millions of talented students, especially from low‑income, rural, or marginalised backgrounds, never even get a chance. The reasons go beyond tuition fees. </p>



<p>For many, the pathway to college is blocked by a maze of social and institutional barriers like a lack of information and guidance, complex scholarship processes, digital and language divides, and entrenched biases around caste, gender and field of study. As <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/developing-contemporary-india/why-many-marginalised-students-cant-access-scholarships/#:~:text=too%20well%3A%20While%20scholarships%20are,system%20leaves%20too%20many%20behind" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">one recent survey</a> cautions, <strong>“scholarships are essential, [but they] often fall short of addressing the full range of challenges faced by students from marginalized backgrounds,”</strong> leaving too many behind.</p>



<p>One young woman’s story captures this gap. <strong>Aishwarya</strong>, an engineering student from a working‑class family in Bengaluru, dreamed of a science career despite her father’s modest income. “I had always dreamt of pursuing a career in science,” she recalls. Yet even after earning a coveted college seat, she struggled: <strong>“The fees, transport, books, and even mobile data for online classes started adding up. It became impossible to continue with my studies.”</strong> Aishwarya’s predicament shows why affordability alone is a reductive way to see the problem. It wasn’t just money – it was every extra cost and complication that overwhelmed her. Schools and scholarships often focus narrowly on tuition, but students like Aishwarya need a safety net that covers all essentials.</p>



<p>But money isn’t the only missing piece. Many first‑generation college students are also navigating an alien world. Classrooms, career counselling, and internship culture can feel utterly foreign to someone from a village or slum. These students may have no one at home to help write a résumé, prepare for an interview, or network professionally. In the words of one scholarship advisor, <strong>“financial aid is just one piece of the puzzle”</strong>. Without guidance, confidence and exposure, even well‑funded students can falter. </p>



<p>Research confirms that bridging “small gaps” in language, transportation, and mentorship can dramatically boost a young person’s confidence and sense of belonging. In other words, handing someone a scholarship but dropping them into a strange new environment is unlikely to yield success. As one report bluntly puts it,<strong> “without complementary support of this kind, financial aid isn’t likely to result in success.”</strong></p>



<p>To overcome these hurdles, holistic scholarship models are emerging. Rather than just paying fees, they wrap students in a blanket of support. A leading example is Smile Foundation’s flagship <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Mission Education</a></strong> programme which pairs financial aid with life‑skills training, English and digital fluency classes, mentorship, career counselling, and even mental health support. Our need‑based sponsorships cover not only school fees but also books, uniforms, stationery, and transport – ensuring continuity from primary school through higher secondary. </p>



<p>We also run bridge and remedial courses for dropouts, giving out‑of‑school youth a second chance at learning. In partnership with corporate <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" title="Corporate Partnerships" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2619" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">CSR</a> funds, Smile even extends vocational and professional scholarships for nursing, computer training and other career paths so that older students gain employable skills.</p>



<p>Girls receive special attention. Smile Foundation notes that female students face gendered expectations, mobility constraints, and lack of access to safe campuses or hostels. To counter this, their scholarships for girls are embedded in a broader strategy providing menstrual hygiene kits, counselling and safe transport arrangements alongside funding. These measures help keep girls in school with dignity and confidence. Indeed, poor infrastructure and social pressure still cause girls in India to drop out in large numbers. </p>



<p>A UNESCO survey found <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/powerful-voices-how-adolescent-girls-in-india-are-breaking-barriers-and-creating-change/#:~:text=of%20safe%20access%20to%20sex,in%20India%20remain%20unaware%20of" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><strong>23 million</strong> girls worldwide each year leave school</a> simply for lack of proper menstrual hygiene facilities – a reality Smile’s programmes directly address by providing sanitary supplies and education. By focusing on the whole student, not just the ledger sheet, holistic scholarships help remove the hidden barriers that money alone cannot fix.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-the-classroom-to-the-career"><strong>From the classroom to the career</strong></h2>



<p>Of course, going to college is only the first step. Equally important is what comes after, and here too, India faces an urgent challenge. As industry surveys repeatedly show, there is a growing <strong>employability gap</strong>. The latest India Skills Report (2025 edition) found that only about 54.81% of Indian graduates are considered job‑ready by industry standards. In other words, nearly half of college grads still lack the soft skills, digital know‑how, or career orientation that employers want. This is a dilemma for students and donors alike of a degree that doesn’t lead to a job is a missed opportunity.</p>



<p>Bridging this gap requires purposeful integration of skills and internship opportunities into scholarship programmes. Smile Foundation’s vocational scholars, for example, gain real workplace exposure through internships and industry workshops. One beneficiary, <strong>Vaishnavi</strong>, speaks for many: working a brief internship in a Mumbai office <strong>“changed my self-perception entirely,” she says. “Until then, I never thought someone like me could work in a place like that… Now I know I can.”</strong> This transformation, from classroom confidence to career confidence, is exactly the aim.</p>



<p>Smaller initiatives aren’t enough; we need system‑wide change. India’s National Education Policy 2020 (NEP) acknowledges this by calling for stronger links between academia and industry. In practice, NEP mandates that universities experiment with vocational education and include mandatory internships and apprenticeships in their curricula. CSR partnerships can accelerate this by helping align college curricula with real job skills, sponsor laboratory facilities, or digital labs, and mentor students. Several Indian CSR guidelines now encourage firms to support educational initiatives, and many companies do fund scholarship seats but often without the accompanying training. For true impact, CSR‑funded scholarships should come bundled with career bootcamps, group discussions, mock interviews, and internships.</p>



<p>Such public‑private collaboration also builds social capital. When students meet mentors and industry leaders, they learn the norms of professional life – the resume buzzwords, presentation etiquette, and networking savvy that others pick up informally. These interactions set realistic expectations and open doors. If a bright rural student sits down with an engineer who once came from a similar village, she gains both inspiration and guidance. As Smile Foundation’s scholarship head emphasises, the goal is to ensure students aren’t just enrolled, but ready for the workplace. With this model, a scholarship becomes a ladder from school all the way into a career.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-definition-of-access"><strong>A new definition of “Access”</strong></h2>



<p>At its core, this approach asks us to redefine “access” to higher education. Access isn’t achieved the moment a student steps through the college gate; it is truly realised only when she completes her degree and walks into a job that matches her potential. This shift changes everything. Students who receive wraparound support – mentorship, life skills training, and career exposure – have dramatically higher retention and graduation rates. In fact, they build what educators call <strong>identity capital</strong>: the confidence, connections, and self‑understanding that let them convert an education into opportunity. One study of peer‑mentoring camps found that <strong><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/powerful-voices-how-adolescent-girls-in-india-are-breaking-barriers-and-creating-change/#:~:text=who%20later%20became%20Sakhis,the%20cycle%20can%20be%20broken" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">96% of disadvantaged girls went on to higher education</a></strong> when given comprehensive support.</p>



<p>These success stories ripple outward. A single girl who becomes a professional can transform the aspirations of her whole community. Her siblings see her example and dare to dream; her parents feel vindicated in educating daughters. In the long run, every such scholar is a social mobility agent. In economic terms, investing in holistic scholarships is like investing in a multiplier, one income‑earning graduate can indirectly benefit dozens of others.</p>



<p>For donors and CSR leaders, the implication is clear that funding fees is necessary, but not sufficient. Smart investments target multiple needs simultaneously. For example, Smile Foundation in 2023 reached 120,000 students with educational programmes, supported 44,000 girls with school and vocational training, and funded 2,000 scholarships for higher studies. These efforts are not stand‑alone; they are integrated with teacher training, lab upgrades and <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2620" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> campaigns. An evaluator might not see the tagline “scholarship” on every initiative, but together they form a ladder that keeps students climbing.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rethinking-the-scholarship-model"><strong>Rethinking the scholarship model</strong></h2>



<p>There is no one-size-fits-all solution, but certain principles have emerged:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Simplify and localise the process:</strong> Make applications user-friendly, available in regional languages, and accessible through a single portal. As YDF researchers note, the current system “often falls short” because students face underused online portals and confusing forms. Providing local outreach and translation can close this gap.</li>



<li><strong>Provide upfront, comprehensive support:</strong> Move away from reimbursement models that force families to front fees. Scholarships should cover tuition and supplies before the semester starts. Even small hidden costs like photocopying certificates or paying for internet access can derail a poor student. Covering uniforms, travel, and exam fees up front ensures no one is left waiting or indebted.</li>



<li><strong>Bundle life skills and mentorship:</strong> Accompany funding with regular counseling, communication workshops, and peer mentorship. Smile Foundation encapsulates this by embedding scholarships in life-skills training in a language students understand. Such holistic care from teaching time management to providing psychosocial support boosts resilience.</li>



<li><strong>Prioritise girls and the most disadvantaged:</strong> Design eligibility criteria around socioeconomic need, not just grades. Scholarship programmes must explicitly counter gender and caste bias. Initiatives like Smile’s <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/donation/support-girl-child" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">She Can Fly</a></strong> recognise that for many families, sending a daughter to a distant college is a social challenge as much as a financial one. By including menstrual hygiene kits, counselling, and safe lodging in a girls’ scholarship package, one organisation can dramatically improve female retention.</li>



<li><strong>Partner with industry and education systems:</strong> Scholarships should be the bridge between school and the workplace. CSR funding can create scholarship seats tied to internships or apprenticeships. Colleges can work with employers to adapt curriculum and host career fairs. The NEP 2020 envisions incubation centres and vocational tracks in universities – donors can help build these bridges by funding projects, labs, and student exchange with industry.</li>



<li><strong>Track and share success:</strong> Document case studies of students who have thrived with holistic support. Anecdotes like Vaishnavi’s success are inspiring, but scaling best practices requires data. If governments and NGOs pool evidence on which combinations of support lead to graduation and jobs, we can replicate what works.</li>
</ul>



<p>Implementing such a model takes coordination, but the payoff is enormous. For donors and CSR heads, the message is clear: <strong>Invest in the whole student, not just the fees. </strong>A truly equitable higher education system will not emerge from fee waivers alone. It will be built by understanding students’ lives – their journeys, hurdles, and aspirations – and filling every gap along the way.</p>



<p>By closing gaps in both tuition and opportunity, holistic scholarships pave a fairer, more durable path to success. They ensure that a poor student not only gets in, but also moves forward. Only by redefining access in this way can India truly unleash the potential of its youth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a quiet classroom in Odisha, a girl named Shalini stood up to answer a question. She had no idea her life was about to change. A red stain on her seat, a marker of her first period, brought giggles, whispers, and then silence. No one had told her what menstruation was. She thought she was ill. The next day, overwhelmed by shame, she begged her parents not to send her back to school. And just like that, the promise of a brighter future began to fade.</p>



<p>Shalini’s story is not unique. Across rural India, girls face a combination of stigma, silence, and inaccessibility when it comes to managing their periods. Without awareness, proper facilities, or access to sanitary products, many are pushed out of classrooms, losing days of learning and, eventually, the opportunity for a better future.</p>

<p><strong>UNICEF &amp; WATERAID INDIA STUDY (2015)*</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-unspoken-numbers"><strong>The unspoken numbers</strong></h2>



<p>According to UNICEF India, over 253 million adolescents live in India, with nearly half being girls and 25% of them in rural areas. Despite several government-led menstrual hygiene initiatives, thousands of girls still drop out of school due to shame, pain, poor access to products, and lack of supportive infrastructure.</p>



<p>A qualitative study in six Delhi government schools found that around <a href="https://jointactionforwater.org/a-study-of-school-absenteeism-during-menstruation-amongst-adolescent-girls-in-india/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">40% of girls missed school</a> during menstruation owing to menstrual pain, fear of staining, and restrictive social norms.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-period-absenteeism-why">Period absenteeism-why?</h3>



<p>Whether in rural villages or urban neighbourhoods, a girl’s first period often arrives unannounced and with fear. Her body undergoes unfamiliar changes, but in the absence of support and information, this moment becomes isolating. When compounded by poor infrastructure, stigma, and silence, menstruation becomes not just a personal struggle, but an educational barrier.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Social taboos&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Even today, in many parts of India, menstruating girls and women are subjected to regressive restrictions like being barred from entering temples, kitchens, or even touching food on the grounds of being “impure.” These practices are reinforced by harmful myths, such as the belief that menstrual blood is toxic or that using sanitary pads causes infertility. As a result, many girls are pushed toward using cloth or other unhygienic alternatives compromising their <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2606" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a>, dignity, and confidence.</p>



<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Poor menstrual product access</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>In many rural communities, girls face limited access to safe menstrual products, clean cloth. or private drying spaces. Adding to their troubles is the issue of no proper disposal facilities; they often resort to using ashes or rags as quiet acts of desperation that compromise their health and dignity.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Menstrual hygiene in Indian women (15-24yrs)</strong></p>



<p>Recent data reflects encouraging progress: 78% of women in India now use hygienic menstrual methods such as sanitary napkins, tampons, or menstrual cups indicating growing awareness and improved access. However, among adolescent girls, only 42% rely exclusively on these hygienic practices*, with significant disparities persisting across states and districts. This gap underscores the urgent need for targeted interventions that address both availability and cultural barriers in underserved regions.</p>



<p><em>Menstrual hygiene practices among adolescent women in rural India: a cross-sectional study</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeNTUwnB5U0K46Gp1CXcPGNGWqh7fA6kJfVctJhTGmgf2jU9o4pe6E1nW2TOA99V09n9Rdu4bZqwUY8U03gS6RVjIZrXf287cQjcJEPE8I4kk7as5qko7XVA3kFAEPazop1WFKaZQ?key=-SWeFV2KTfjqIdMTjWd1DA" alt=""/></figure>

<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Paying the hidden cost of secrecy and infrastructure gaps</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Many girls across rural India navigate their periods in secrecy by hiding pads in books, fearing stains, missing school events, and sometimes their yearly reviews as well because of menstruation. With no dustbins, running water, or private toilets in schools, managing menstrual hygiene becomes near impossible. The result is a deafening mix of isolation, shame, and lost days of learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Menstrual health is a national priority</strong></p>



<p>India has taken steps in the right direction. The Menstrual Hygiene Scheme (MHS), by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, offers subsidised sanitary napkins and peer counselling through ASHA workers. The Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK) promotes adolescent health, including menstrual awareness. The Suvidha Scheme by the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilisers introduced biodegradable sanitary pads at ₹1, increasing affordability.</p>



<p>Yet gaps persist. Many of these programmes struggle to reach India’s most marginalised girls. Product availability doesn’t always translate to product use, especially when surrounded by silence and stigma.</p>



<p>As a result, many adolescent girls navigate menstruation in isolation—confused, unprepared, and unsupported. For countless girls, this social conditioning leads to school absenteeism, diminishing their confidence, academic continuity, and long-term opportunities.</p>



<p><strong>Addressing the gaps through strategic partnerships&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>To bridge these challenges, strategic CSR–NGO partnerships are serving as catalytic agents. By combining grassroots reach with corporate scale, these collaborations have the potential to advance menstrual hygiene management as a systemic solution driving health equity, school retention, and long-term social impact for adolescent girls across India.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-improving-school-infrastructure-beyond-brick-and-mortar"><strong>Improving school infrastructure beyond brick and mortar</strong></h3>



<p>One major challenge for school girls from rural communities during menstruation is the lack of functional school infrastructure; poor washrooms, inadequate disposal, limited water, and no privacy often lead to school dropouts.</p>



<p><strong>What can be done</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Support the development of gender sensitive washrooms with lockable doors, running water, disposable bins and incinerators.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>By partnering with NGOs, corporates can implement their CSR goals for women empowerment. Through impact dashboards, the projects can be tracked to identify the usage, maintenance, and overall the hygienic parameters required for young girls in home and schools.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-culture-stigma-needs-community-solutions-nbsp"><strong>Culture stigma needs community solutions&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>One of the most important issues that must be addressed immediately at a large scale is the lack of awareness about <strong>menstrual health </strong>amongst young girls and their communities. This becomes more concerning when the concerns of young girls are silenced due to vulture silence, shame, and myths that often lead to fear, poor hygiene, and isolation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What can be done</strong></p>



<p>Corporates can support community based menstrual literacy programmes where they can collaborate with local organisations, ASHA workers and peer educators to increase awareness on menstrual hygiene. Furthermore, they can also educate the girls, teachers and community workers through culturally adapted IEC tools (flipbooks, comics, digital stories ) to challenge taboos and normalise conversations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take the example of <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/smilescapes-august-2024/in-focus-3/#:~:text=A%20case%20in%20point%20here,developed%20a%20health%2Dseeking%20behavior." data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Shivani</a>. Once hesitant and withdrawn, she found her footing through menstrual health sessions conducted by Smile Foundation’s <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/women-empowerment/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Swabhiman</a> programme. With accurate information and support, she gained not only knowledge, but also the confidence to speak up. Today, she serves as a peer educator empowering other adolescent girls in her community and promoting health-seeking behaviour.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of its integrated approach to women’s health, Smile Foundation’s Swabhiman trains <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/workshops-events/27-swabhiman-volunteers-trained-on-reproductive-and-menstrual-health-2/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">community-based volunteers</a> as reproductive and menstrual health educators in underserved areas. This capacity-building intervention strategically addresses knowledge gaps, dismantles cultural taboos, and promotes safe menstrual hygiene practices directly reducing school absenteeism and health risks among adolescent girls. By embedding peer-led advocacy into last-mile delivery, the initiative strengthens behavioural change at the community level while aligning with national adolescent health goals and SDG targets.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-making-innovation-accessible-affordable-and-adaptable-nbsp"><strong>Making innovation accessible, affordable, and adaptable&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>As key drivers of social impact, CSR–NGO partnerships are well positioned to eliminate unhygienic menstrual practices such as the use of cloth, ash, or sacks by co-developing and scaling access to affordable sanitary products tailored for rural adolescent girls. In light of growing environmental concerns, these partnerships must also prioritise innovation in biodegradable and reusable menstrual solutions, ensuring both adolescent health and ecological sustainability. Such an approach aligns with ESG goals and supports long-term, community-based health equity.</p>



<p><strong>What can be done</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Support women-led production units for biodegradable sanitary napkins or menstrual cups.</li>



<li>Collaborate on last mile distribution through workshops in local communities and schools, <em>Anganwadis </em>and frontline health workers.</li>
</ul>



<p>For instance, through targeted <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/workshops-events/workshop-on-menstrual-hygiene-to-spread-awareness-on-safe-menstrual-practices-2/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">workshops on menstrual hygiene</a>, Smile Foundation’s Swabhiman programme ensures last-mile delivery of accurate, stigma-free education to adolescent girls in underserved communities. By promoting body literacy and safe hygiene practices, the initiative empowers girls with the confidence to stay in school, safeguard their health, and become agents of change in their communities.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">

<p>Swabhiman addresses menstrual hygiene as a critical enabler of uninterrupted <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2607" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> for adolescent girls in rural India. By training peer educators, frontline volunteers, and community health workers, Swabhiman delivers accurate, stigma-free menstrual literacy at the grassroots. It also facilitates access to sanitary products, promotes hygienic practices, and advocates for safe, girl-friendly school sanitation infrastructure. This integrated approach reduces absenteeism and school dropouts caused by menstruation-related challenges. Aligned with national priorities and SDGs 4 and 5, Swabhiman empowers girls to manage menstruation with dignity transforming it from a source of shame into a gateway for continued learning and confidence.</p>

									<p>Unfortunately, development organisations from the south do not play a significant decision-making role in global conversations, thereby limiting their access to donors and funds. Not only does it make scaling our solutions more challenging, it also delays reaching a common ground between the global south and north. For example, donors from the north often say that capacity must be built, but fail to understand that capacity cannot be built when very limited funding is available. As a result, development organisations from the south become subcontractors for development organisations of the north. These subcontractors have no authority and often have to operate with margins that barely cover their costs – not to mention capacity building.</p><p>Development should focus on long-term solutions rather than short-term projects, and these solutions need funding for them to be scalable and sustainable. However, many donors believe that organisations in the global south are risky business partners, creating a self-reinforcing chicken-and-egg situation. Donors from the north do not provide funds because partners from the south lack capacity that cannot be built due to a lack of funds. Although there has been talk of local anchoring for a long time, little progress has been made with this very paradox.</p>								</div>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>With mental health issues among children surging globally, schools have emerged as critical frontlines for early intervention. Teachers, often closest to students’ daily lives, can detect emotional distress and foster inclusive, supportive environments. Smile Foundation’s school-based mental health initiatives in India highlight the transformative role educators can play. Integrating emotional well-being into school systems is a strategic investment in shaping healthier, more resilient generations worldwide.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a Smile Foundation <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/smile-foundation_projectmanzil-vocationaltraining-skillindia-activity-7289617524197933057-2A6m#:~:text=session%20with%20Grade%206%20students%2C,their%20vision%20of%20a%20dream" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">workshop</a> on social-emotional learning, a grade-six girl captured the dilemma facing India’s children: “Didi, happiness har jagah hai lekin safe nahi hain!” (Sister, happiness is everywhere, but it doesn’t always feel safe). That simple line highlights a hidden crisis. After the COVID years UNESCO warned that children and adolescents have been experiencing a heightened level of stress and anxiety, and globally one in seven <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/union-minister-education-launches-unescos-mental-health-guide-students-india#:~:text=Children%20and%20adolescents%20are%20more,the%20mental%20wellbeing%20of%20students" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">10–19-year-olds</a> now lives with a mental disorder. Our schools, the very places meant to nurture growth, are instead becoming pressure-cookers for anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>A study by NIMHANS found that roughly 23% of Indian schoolchildren have significant mental <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2624" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> issues (anxiety, depression, behavioural disorders). The National Mental Health Survey (2015–16) similarly showed 7.3% of adolescents (age 13–17) meeting criteria for psychiatric illness. Much to the chagrin of the country&#8217;s needs, India spends less than 1% of its health budget on mental health, and has just 0.29 psychiatrists per lakh people (with virtually none specialising in children). </p>
<p>The fallout is deadly with student suicides nearly doubling in a decade, from 7,696 in 2011 to 13,089 in 2021, and among those under 18 the majority cite mental health as a contributing factor. In short, India’s schoolchildren are living in a storm of stress, with too few shelters.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-schoolyard-stress-test-for-mental-health-of-children"><strong>The schoolyard stress test for mental health of children</strong></h2>
<p>Government data confirm what students privately tell us. In a 2022 NCERT survey of about 3.8 lakh middle- and high-school students (under the Ministry’s <em>Manodarpan</em> initiative), <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/education/world-mental-health-day-2022-81-school-students-anxious-about-studies-and-exam-results-shows-ncert-survey-8198381/#:~:text=anxiety" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><strong>81% said academic pressure</strong></a> of studies and exams triggered their anxiety. Frequent mood swings and exam fear were widespread, worsening from middle to secondary grades and affecting girls slightly more than boys. These students may score high on standardised tests but low on emotional well-being: most reported being satisfied with school life and feeling responsible for doing well, yet a declining sense of support and happiness as they advanced to higher grades. In practice, a child struggling with self-doubt or bullying often carries the burden home, untold and unaddressed, until the grades or the gap become too wide to bridge.</p>
<p>In this context, schools must become safe spaces and first-response centres for children’s emotional health. Adolescence is a critical window. WHO notes that protective school environments can shape lifelong habits of resilience and social learning. Children who feel respected, accepted, and belonging in class are far more likely to engage and learn; those who feel unsafe or stigmatised tend to shut down or act out. International agencies accordingly urge a broad, integrated approach. UNICEF’s framework for a School Mental Health Programme calls for </p>
<p>(1) a positive learning environment</p>
<p>(2) early access to counseling and support</p>
<p>(3) focus on teacher well-being</p>
<p>(4) targeted interventions (e.g. group counselling, yoga classes)</p>
<p>(5) collaboration with families and communities</p>
<p>Under India’s Ayushman Bharat School Health Program, states now promote meditation, anti-bullying campaigns, internet safety, and substance-abuse prevention in schools. Likewise, the National Education Policy (2020) and Delhi’s Happiness Curriculum have officially recognised social-emotional learning (SEL) as a pillar of holistic education valuing mindfulness, empathy, and life skills alongside academics. These are all positive moves.</p>
<p>But policy is not yet practice. India still lacks a uniform, well-funded School Mental Health Program. Schemes often focus on physical check-ups; psychosocial concerns get far less attention. A School Health &amp; Wellness Programme was launched, but it runs up against a huge manpower gap. In the Smile Foundation’s survey of campus needs, faculty themselves report seeing kids who are anxious or withdrawn, but few teachers have training to notice signs or respond. In public schools especially, the ratio of counsellors (if any) to students is pitiful.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-teachers-and-curriculum-the-first-responders"><strong>Teachers and curriculum: The first responders</strong></h2>
<p>Teachers are the vanguard of a <strong>first response</strong> system. They see students daily and can flag red flags in behaviour or mood. International research confirms that simple steps like greeting children warmly, listening without judgment, praising effort significantly boost self-confidence and a growth mindset. The curriculum too can reinforce emotional literacy. For example, Delhi’s weekly <strong>happiness class</strong> uses stories and discussions to teach empathy and coping. Other states now run <em>Manodarpan</em> counselling sessions or life-skills classes, as envisaged by NEP 2020.</p>
<p>Under its <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Mission Education</a></strong> programme, Smile Foundation holds regular teacher training on classroom management and child pedagogy. These sessions train educators to spot anxiety and build connections teaching that empathy and compassion are essential components for fostering acceptance. In Smile’s partner schools, teachers learn to see each child’s uniqueness. One girl named <em>Tanisha</em>, for example, was found to have exceptional skills in arts and crafts, and teachers then gave her special materials and encouragement to nurture that talent. Such gestures may seem small, but they send a powerful message that a child is seen and valued.</p>
<p>When classrooms become emotionally safe, learning transforms. Smile reports that in its centres, children who once sat in silence now raise hands without fear – they know their voices matter, and their journeys are valued. Extracurricular clubs and celebrations also play a role: think poetry circles, arts exhibitions or sports days that include all children. Every inclusive activity offers peer support and stress relief. Parents in Smile’s programmes are also engaged through community meetings and workshops, because parents are crucial partners. </p>
<p>UNICEF and WHO stress that involvement of families is part of any success because schools should not work in isolation. When a parent knows how to talk to a teen about coping, and a teacher knows how to guide them back into the classroom family, the social web around each child strengthens.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smile-s-story-on-the-ground-impact"><strong>Smile’s story: On-the-ground impact</strong></h2>
<p>The challenges are complex, but the results can be immediate. In Mumbai’s Smile-run partner School, a trainer led a Grade 6 session imagining a city of happiness. The children sketched parks, gardens and smiling families – yet one child dared to voice a fear, “Didi, happiness har jagah hai lekin safe nahi hain”. This candid admission ignited a rich discussion on safety and empathy. Teachers and Smile counsellors sat with students to unpack what <strong>safety</strong> means: emotional safety in relationships, the confidence to ask for help, knowing it’s OK to feel uneasy. In follow-up classes, students learned mindfulness exercises and peer-support strategies.</p>
<p>On the other side of town, in Smile’s village outreach, grade-9 students who were once frightened of exams now practice group meditation and peer counselling under Smile guidance. Teachers report seeing more smiles and more willingness to share problems. A senior teacher remarked, “After our weekly mentor-mentee meetings, I can see shy students beginning to speak up. They know someone is listening.” Another said, “Kids who never wanted to come to school are now arriving early, they say school feels like a second home.” These anecdotal outcomes resonate with the research that shows children with mental support do better academically and have lower dropout rates than those who don’t.</p>
<p>Smile’s approach also emphasises curriculum. Storytelling and role-play are woven into daily lessons; value education now means open conversations about anxiety and resilience. The goal is to give children the language to express feelings. One boy, after a Smile-led session on stress, told his teacher, “I thought I was the only one with exam nightmares. Now we talk about it and do breathing exercises together.” Such peer normalisation of mental health is invaluable.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, Smile also conducts stress management workshops for students and faculty. Counsellors train teachers to look for warning signs of burnout in students and even in themselves. Parents and community health workers are given pamphlets and attended village meetings so they, too, can support adolescents at risk. In one Smile centre, a community festival included a <strong>Feelings Wall</strong>, where children stuck notes about when they felt happy, worried or angry, initiating conversations across generations about emotions. These micro-interventions create a culture of care.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-high-returns-the-csr-imperative-for-mental-health-of-children"><strong>High returns: The CSR imperative</strong> <strong>for mental health of children</strong></h2>
<p>For <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" title="Corporate Partnerships" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2625" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">CSR</a> and corporate philanthropy, supporting mental health of children is a <strong>high-impact investment</strong>. When a company funds a school counsellor or an SEL workshop, it empowers dozens of children and families. Every rupee spent on early emotional support can save on future costs: less need for remedial education, lower healthcare burdens, and a more productive workforce down the line. In fact, global studies (WHO, UNESCO) note that every dollar invested in child mental health yields multiple dollars in later economic benefit (through higher lifetime earnings and reduced social costs). The Indian context adds urgency of addressing children’s emotional wellbeing breaking cycles of poverty and abuse that underlie many social problems.</p>
<p>Investing in mental health in schools also aligns perfectly with CSR guidelines and NEP 2020 goals. CSR for education in India has often focused on infrastructure or scholarships. Adding mental wellness programmes is the logical next step. The NEP itself envisions <strong>holistic education</strong> nurturing not just the mind, but also health, values, and creativity. CSR funds can accelerate this vision. Section 135 of the Companies Act and the CSR Rules explicitly encourage projects on health and education; supporting counsellors, training teachers in SEL, and running awareness campaigns all qualify. Moreover, organisations that champion mental health in schools send a strong message that they are caring for the future talent pool and demonstrating genuine social responsibility.</p>
<p>Several CSR projects are already moving in this direction. For example, Smile Foundation’s corporate partners have co-founded <strong>wellness corners </strong>in schools, complete with counsellor desks and meditation mats. Companies find that such initiatives boost teacher morale and community relations, besides quantifiable impact (higher attendance, reduced dropouts). Importantly, working through an NGO like Smile provides monitoring and evaluation, so CSR leaders see clear outcomes tied to their funds.</p>
<p>The <strong>return on investment</strong> for society and for companies’ reputations is huge. A generation of emotionally healthy students is more likely to become engaged citizens and employees. They will miss fewer workdays, require less medical leave, and contribute creatively rather than retreating. For women’s empowerment and gender equity, the payoff is even greater. Adolescent girls with strong support networks are far less likely to drop out or enter early marriage, and better able to pursue higher education or careers. That rings especially true given NEP’s focus on keeping girls in school and giving every child voice and choice.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-build-the-future-with-care"><strong>Build the future with care</strong></h2>
<p>The mental health crisis in India’s schools cannot be fixed by one sector alone. It requires government, educators, communities, and critically, the <strong>CSR ecosystem</strong> to step up. CSR decision-makers can show the way by prioritising school-based interventions as part of their education and health portfolios. This means funding counsellor training, counselling centres, teacher workshops, SEL curricula, and campaigns that destigmatise mental health in villages and cities alike. It means measuring success not only in test scores, but in happier, more resilient children.</p>
<p>The government has laid the policy groundwork (NEP 2020, <em>Manodarpan</em>, school health programmes) and NGOs like Smile are on the ground implementing models. The missing ingredient is scale which CSR can provide. By channelling CSR for education in India towards emotional wellbeing, companies will fulfil NEP’s vision of holistic growth. They will also help India meet Sustainable Development Goal 4 (inclusive quality education) and SDG 3 (good health and well-being).</p>
<p>Just as importantly, this work aligns with the human story behind the data. Every invested rupee carries a message to a child: <strong>“We see you, we value you, and we will help you.”</strong> As one Smile educator puts it, their mission is not only to educate the mind but to make children aware of their feelings and help them find a voice. </p>
<p>For India’s CSR leaders, this is a challenge worth embracing. By supporting mental health of children, CSR can plant the seeds of a happier, healthier India. Indeed, the school classroom may be where the future truly begins – let us make it a secure and nurturing place for every child.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>India’s ambition to produce world-class athletes must begin in its classrooms. Unlike global counterparts where structured sports education fuels national excellence, most Indian schools still treat sports as extracurricular. For children from low-resource communities, this means lost opportunity. Investing in sports education is about confidence, discipline, and equity. By integrating structured physical education into every school, India can realise its untapped talent and build healthier, more resilient futures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>India has long celebrated its scholars, but sports remain a vast unexplored frontier, especially for children in government schools and low-income communities. Around the world, nations like Kenya, Brazil, and China have harnessed early sports infrastructure to win medals and also to shape discipline, confidence, and social mobility at scale. In India, however, inequality in sports access reinforces educational and economic disparities.</p>



<p>Smile Foundation’s<strong> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJooVhxTFfJ/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Education Quality Improvement Project (EQuIP)</a></strong> launched across hundreds of government schools integrates sports infrastructure and activity into school transformation. As India grapples with under-performance in global sports stages, particularly from public sector schools, the urgency to invest in grassroots sports for social change has never been clearer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-global-story-how-nations-turn-grassroots-into-gold"><strong>The global story: How nations turn grassroots into gold</strong></h2>



<p>Kenya’s world-class runners often trace their beginnings to rural highlands where daily life blends endurance with competition. Brazil’s football culture starts in neighbourhood courts, fostering informal learning, and improvisation from early childhood. China’s structured school and local systems identify athletic talent early across swimming, gymnastics, and table tennis.</p>



<p>Those countries teach a simple lesson: <strong>sports is not just extracurricular</strong>, <strong>it is infrastructure for confidence and belonging</strong>.</p>



<p>Outcomes are tangible. Kenyan youth benefit from discipline and resilience; Brazilian sports schools nurture self-esteem alongside skills; and Chinese urban-rural sports academies increase upward mobility and national pride. In contrast, India’s public education system offers stadium-scale infrastructure only to a select few, the remainder often go unserved.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-india-s-gap-talent-exists-but-opportunity-does-not"><strong>India’s gap: Talent exists but opportunity does not</strong></h2>



<p>India’s public school system remains largely academic. Most government schools have no playgrounds, no trained coaches, and limited organised physical education. Research shows <strong>over 80% of low-income schools lack basic sports infrastructure</strong>. As a result, students miss out on building crucial life skills like teamwork, perseverance, spatial awareness that employers increasingly value.</p>



<p>For underserved children, the impact is more severe. With limited recreational avenues and NO recognition for sporting ability, students from rural or peri-urban backgrounds are rarely shortlisted for scholarships or sports-based entry into education streams. The talent pool remains dormant, not for lack of ability, but for absence of opportunity.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-sport-belongs-in-classrooms"><strong>Why sport belongs in classrooms</strong></h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Improved Attendance and Engagement</strong>: Schools offering regular sports activities report up to 30% better attendance. Play becomes incentive to come to school and stay.</li>



<li><strong>Enhanced Well-Being and Mental <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2627" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Health</a></strong>: Physical activity reduces anxiety, builds emotional resilience, and improves concentration in class.</li>



<li><strong>Skill Building for the Workforce</strong>: Gig work, hospitality, retail—all demand teamwork, discipline, and adaptability—traits honed through sport.</li>



<li><strong>Equity and Inclusion</strong>: Sports allow children to succeed outside of exams, even those with academic struggles can shine.</li>
</ul>



<p>These benefits are systemic. A child who learns to run relay or shoot hoops under supervision builds confidence that a quiz score may never inspire.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smile-foundation-and-equip-sports-as-part-of-school-transformation"><strong>Smile Foundation and EQuIP: Sports as part of school transformation</strong></h2>



<p>Smile Foundation’s <strong>EQuIP initiative</strong> works in low‑resource government schools across 15 states, supporting over 1,660 schools as part of its <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Mission Education(ME)</a></strong> centres. While its broader goal is improving learning outcomes, EQuIP stands out for embedding sports within every school’s transformation strategy.</p>



<p>Key elements include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Provision of <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/imfact/2023/education.html?" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">play materials and infrastructure</a></strong> like balls, hoops, and safe play spaces.</li>



<li><strong>Organising sports meets</strong>: Smile ran athletics events like long jump, shot put, races for students from Mission Education Centres, with coaching support and gear.</li>



<li><strong>Teacher training</strong> on how to integrate physical activities into daily classroom time.</li>



<li><strong>Linking health with play</strong>: sports, well-being sessions, nutrition education, all working together under EQuIP.</li>
</ul>



<p>One highlight: in Pune, ME children selected through school trials participated in a broader sports meet with Smile supplying equipment and support. These experiences build early exposure to organised athletics without requiring elite pathways.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-social-impact-through-sport-what-evidence-shows"><strong>Social impact through sport: What evidence shows</strong></h2>



<p>While Smile’s internal metrics are still maturing, broader studies demonstrate:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>30% higher retention rates</strong> in primary school where physical activities are embedded.</li>



<li><strong>Improved gender inclusion</strong>: in mixed sports meets, girls show increased participation and confidence.</li>



<li><strong>Teacher motivation</strong>: where simple tournaments take place, staff morale improves and absenteeism drops.</li>



<li><strong>Parental trust and engagement</strong>: communities form pride when their children represent the school in sports.</li>
</ul>



<p>In Smile’s Pune pilot, adolescent girls involved in sports reported stronger school engagement and expressed new ambition about higher education and employment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-csr-and-policy-makers-should-care"><strong>Why CSR and policy makers should care</strong></h3>



<p>Social innovation programmes and <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" title="Corporate Partnerships" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2628" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">CSR</a> funders must recognise a simple truth that <strong>sport equals social capital</strong>. By partnering with school transformation efforts like EQuIP, CSR efforts unlock multiple returns:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Education outcomes</strong>: focus on the whole child.</li>



<li><strong>Equity</strong>: sports opportunity is one of the few levelers.</li>



<li><strong>Talent pipeline</strong>: scholarship, vocational access, and eventual employment.</li>



<li><strong>Scalable rollout</strong>: low-cost models of sports integration can be replicated across districts.</li>
</ul>



<p>CSR budgets targeted at education or nutrition alone miss the multiplicative impact of investing in simple sports infrastructure. A patch of ground, a ball, an annual sports meet—these create space for identity, movement, belonging.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-india-must-act-now"><strong>Why India must act now</strong></h3>



<p>India lags not due to lack of athletes but due to a lack of structured, inclusive sporting opportunities. Other nations design for equity:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Brazil’s Favela PC initiatives bring football training into informal settlements.</li>



<li>Kenya partners with NGOs to deliver school-based athletics hubs.</li>



<li>China’s <strong>sunshine sports</strong> agenda mandates rural school participation in sports.</li>
</ul>



<p>India’s public system grants <strong>stipend-level fellowships</strong> to Olympic hopefuls, but offers nothing to the child running barefoot in a government school playground.</p>



<p>Smile Foundation’s EQuIP offers a middle ground, a meaningful, scalable, low-cost sport integration into public schools, where most Indian children study.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-recommendations-for-stakeholders"><strong>Recommendations for stakeholders</strong></h3>



<p>To amplify impact, stakeholders should urgently consider:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Policy Integration</strong>: Ministry of Education can institute mandatory minimal sports infrastructure and activity days in government school norms.</li>



<li><strong>CSR Collaboration</strong>: Brands investing in education should allocate a portion to sports infrastructure—play spaces, coach training, tournaments.</li>



<li><strong>Public-Private Partnership Scaling</strong>: Models like EQuIP should be replicated state-wide with measurable outcomes tied to attendance and well-being indicators.</li>



<li><strong>Monitoring &amp; Evidence Building</strong>: Collect longitudinal student data like attendance, drop-out, psychosocial well‑being from sports-intervened schools.</li>



<li><strong>Inclusive Design</strong>: Ensure facilities are gender-sensitive, disability‑inclusive, and culturally adapted.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-promise-worth-investing-in"><strong>A promise worth investing in</strong></h3>



<p>In villages across Almora, Kangra, Odisha, and Mumbai, Smile-supported schools show that even simple sports events can change how a child sees herself. Not only as a student, but a runner, a jumper, a team player. These identities matter. They seed ambitions that exams alone may never rea;lise.</p>



<p>Public policy and CSR must recognise this truth: <strong>sport breeds social agency</strong>.</p>



<p>When India truly commits to building equitable sports ecosystems in schools, the country will no longer produce only academics but confident, disciplined, resilient young citizens ready to shape India’s future.</p>

<p>Far beyond the bustling metropolises of India, beyond the murmurs of New Delhi’s Rajpath or the gleam of Mumbai’s skylines, lies a land often described as the <strong>roof of the world</strong>. Ladakh, with its dramatic peaks and unforgiving winters, is both majestic and merciless. </p>

<p>At Smile Foundation’s<strong> <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Mission Education</a> </strong>residential centre in Leh, in collaboration with the indigenously anchored <strong>Live To Serve</strong><em> </em>Foundation, young girls—many orphaned, most disadvantaged, and all doubly marginalised by geography and gender—are beginning to reclaim their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/smile-foundation_at-smile-foundations-residential-mission-activity-7342792025345310720-Em7D/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">right to dream</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-oasis-of-hope-with-live-to-serve"><strong>An oasis of hope with Live to Serve</strong></h2>



<p>India’s tryst with destiny has, for too long, skirted around its peripheries—those forgotten geographies that do not quite fit into the seamless narrative of rising GDPs and digital revolutions. Ladakh, with its strategic significance yet stunning infrastructural paucity, remains emblematic of this neglect.</p>



<p>Nowhere is this contradiction more starkly visible than in the lives of its girls. Born into a terrain where survival takes precedence over aspiration, many are shackled not just by altitude but by attitudes with societal prescriptions telling them to stay silent, stay home, stay small.</p>



<p>Enter the Smile supported Life to Serve centre—a modest campus, yet a monumental idea. A space where the daughters of deprivation are not only housed and schooled, but seen and heard. Here, care is not incidental but intentional. Education is not rote but radical.</p>



<p>These girls, once relegated to domestic drudgery or worse, now recite poetry, solve equations, speak of careers in teaching, medicine, and public service. In their laughter echo centuries of silenced voices.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-civilisational-duty-to-educate"><strong>The civilisational duty to educate</strong></h2>



<p>The Indian civilisation, with its grand tradition of <em>vidya daanam</em> (the offering of knowledge) has always extolled education as the ultimate emancipator. Yet we have allowed this noble heritage to wither under the harsh sun of modern inequality. Rural, tribal, and high-altitude regions continue to suffer the ignominy of educational apathy.</p>



<p>Even as national statistics smugly cite near-universal enrollment at primary levels, we must interrogate the lived realities behind these figures. For the girl child in Ladakh’s remote hamlets, school is not merely a building that may or may not exist; it is a question of safe passage, of seasonal migration, of household labour, of dignity itself.</p>



<p>And in that context, Live to Serve&#8217;s residential model offers continuity, care, and the crucible in which a new kind of citizen is forged.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rescuing-girls-from-the-tyranny-of-geography"><strong>Rescuing girls from the tyranny of geography</strong></h3>



<p>Ladakh is no ordinary location. It is a theatre of extremes—altitude, temperature, and politics. For the girls who reside at this centre, it has often meant lives constricted by sheer survival. Some have lost parents. Others belong to families too poor, fractured, or indifferent to invest in a daughter’s education. A few have never even uttered aloud the notion of a dream, let alone dared to pursue one.</p>



<p>Within the warmly lit halls of this centre, nestled against Himalayan winds and history, these girls are beginning to dream out loud.</p>



<p>There is thirteen-year-old Dolma who says, with unwavering certainty, that she will become a doctor. There is Namgyal, who lost both parents to illness and now speaks of founding a school for other orphans. These are acts of defiance against the destinies imposed upon them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="934" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-194558-1024x934.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14186" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-194558-1024x934.png 1024w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-194558-300x274.png 300w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-194558-768x700.png 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-194558.png 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-sublime-symbiosis-of-partnership"><strong>The sublime symbiosis of partnership</strong></h3>



<p>Much of the success of this endeavour lies in its deft balancing act—a rare and commendable synergy between a national player like us and a local actor, Live To Serve Foundation. This is not the usual development of urban NGOs exporting one-size-fits-all solutions to rural India. Instead, it is a partnership steeped in mutual respect and cultural fluency.</p>



<p>Live To Serve Foundation brings with it an intimate knowledge of Ladakhi customs, climate, and community rhythm. Smile Foundation brings scale, systems, and structure. Together, they have created an ecosystem that is both empathetic and effective.</p>



<p>This fusion of the macro and the micro, the institutional and the indigenous, should serve as a template for all development work in India’s hinterlands.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-of-classrooms-and-character"><strong>Of classrooms and character</strong></h3>



<p>What, after all, is the purpose of education? Is it to produce compliant workers for the global economy, or is it to create citizens who are aware, ethical, and empathetic? Our Mission Education centre chooses the latter.</p>



<p>The girls are mentored and encouraged to lead assemblies, to question assumptions, to debate ideas. In a world that routinely underestimates rural children, especially girls, this act of listening becomes revolutionary.</p>



<p>Moreover, the school does not divorce intellect from emotion. Many of its students arrive with invisible wounds like grief, fear, self-doubt. The staff are trained not just in pedagogy but in presence. There is room for mourning, healing, and growing.</p>



<p>In such a climate, confidence is not a consequence but is a curriculum.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="878" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-194616-1024x878.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14187" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-194616-1024x878.png 1024w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-194616-300x257.png 300w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-194616-768x658.png 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-194616.png 1198w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-residential-schooling-a-necessary-investment"><strong>Residential schooling: A necessary investment</strong></h3>



<p>Some may argue that residential schooling is a luxury our nation cannot afford. But we would contend, with all due respect, that it is a necessity we cannot delay. For the child who walks five kilometres each way through snow just to attend a crumbling classroom, or for the girl who must abandon her books to fetch water, residential schools are not indulgences—they are lifelines.</p>



<p>Indeed, globally, residential education for vulnerable populations has been linked with improved learning outcomes, better <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2633" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a>, and long-term social mobility. But India invests too little in these models, often leaving them to flounder.</p>



<p>It is time to change that. And the centre in Ladakh offers a living, breathing argument in favour.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-feminist-frontier-of-climate-justice"><strong>The feminist frontier of climate justice</strong></h3>



<p>An intriguing, and often overlooked, dimension of this initiative is its subtle interweaving of gender and environmental justice. Ladakh is on the frontlines of the climate crisis. Glaciers are melting. Water is scarce. Livelihoods are precarious.</p>



<p>Who better, then, to steward this fragile ecology than educated, locally rooted young women? These girls are already learning about conservation, waste management, and sustainable practices. Their education is not just preparing them for board exams but for an uncertain world where resilience will be a prerequisite.</p>



<p>By educating girls, we are arming Ladakh against both social and ecological disintegration.</p>



<p>This project, inspiring as it is, remains the exception rather than the rule. For every girl studying in Leh, there are hundreds across Kargil, Zanskar, Nubra, and beyond who remain unseen, unheard, and uneducated.</p>



<p>This must change. Government schemes like Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas offer a partial answer but need scaling, monitoring, and the kind of local partnerships that Smile and LTSF exemplify.</p>



<p>We must transform this model into a movement where the right to education is not contingent on one’s caste, class, or coordinates.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-nation-s-test-of-conscience"><strong>A nation’s test of conscience</strong></h3>



<p>The true test of a civilisation is not how it treats its powerful, but how it protects its powerless. By that measure, the girls of Ladakh are the barometer of India’s moral weather.</p>



<p>Are we, as a republic, prepared to walk the talk on <em><strong>beti bachao, beti padhao</strong></em>? Or shall we continue to indulge in tokenism while a generation is left behind?</p>



<p>The girls at our Mission Education centre have answered these questions with their courage, curiosity, and character. It is now our turn to <a href="cp@smilefoundationindia.org" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">fund</a>, to replicate, to listen, and to act.</p>



<p>Their dreams, like the Himalayan winds, cannot be held back. Let us not be the reason they stall. Let us be the reason they soar.</p>

<p>At Smile Foundation’s residential Mission Education Centre in Kangra, children from the pastoral Gaddi tribe are beginning to dream beyond the mountain pastures their families have roamed for generations. Among them is Shreya, a bright, soft-spoken girl whose childhood was shaped by the rhythms of grazing sheep, helping her mother tend to the home, and watching her father leave for distant towns in search of work.</p>



<p>Today, Shreya walks into a classroom instead of trudging across mountain slopes. With the support of Smile Foundation&#8217;s educators, she now studies with the goal to ease her parents’ burden one day. “I want to be there for them the way they’ve always been there for me,” she says, her voice steady with determination.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-gaddi-tribe-culture-geography-and-exclusion"><strong>The Gaddi Tribe: Culture, geography, and exclusion</strong></h2>



<p>The Gaddi tribe is one of the prominent Scheduled Tribes (STs) of Himachal Pradesh. Traditionally semi-nomadic, Gaddis have for centuries migrated seasonally with their flocks of sheep and goats, navigating the high-altitude pastures of the Dhauladhar range in summer and descending to lower altitudes during the harsh winters.</p>



<p>While this lifestyle has given them deep ecological knowledge and cultural resilience, it has also historically excluded them from consistent access to formal education, healthcare, and infrastructure. Many Gaddi settlements are located in remote and hilly regions, such as the interiors of Kangra, Chamba, and parts of Lahaul-Spiti, where schools and roads are either scarce or seasonally inaccessible.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.census2011.co.in/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Census 2011</a> places the literacy rate among Scheduled Tribes in Himachal Pradesh at 73%, slightly above the national ST average of 59%. However, this figure masks wide disparities. In the remotest Gaddi villages, literacy among girls often dips well below 50%. Language barriers, lack of mobility, economic hardships, and deep-rooted gender norms continue to keep tribal children, especially girls, out of school.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-tribal-education-needs-targeted-investment"><strong>Why tribal education needs targeted investment</strong></h2>



<p>Education is more than a right. It is the most powerful tool for breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty. This is especially true for tribal communities, who often face multiple layers of exclusion like geographical isolation, social marginalisation, and lack of culturally relevant pedagogy.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-india-s-st-education-landscape"><strong>1. India’s ST education landscape</strong></h3>



<p>According to the Ministry of Education&#8217;s UDISE+ 2022-23 data:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The dropout rate at the elementary level among ST children remains significantly higher than the national average.</li>



<li>Only 26% of ST students complete secondary education.</li>



<li>Female literacy among STs remains the lowest among all social groups.</li>
</ul>



<p>These numbers represent millions of children who will miss out on economic opportunities, social mobility, and the chance to live lives of dignity and self-determination.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-barriers-to-access-in-tribal-areas"><strong>2. Barriers to access in tribal areas</strong></h3>



<p>Infrastructure is a key challenge. In many tribal belts, schools are located several kilometres away, often requiring students to walk across hilly terrain or through forests. Seasonal weather conditions, especially in mountain regions, further disrupt attendance.</p>



<p>Additionally, many tribal families cannot afford uniforms, transport, or stationery. Girls face greater hurdles. They are often expected to assist with household chores, and concerns about safety or lack of female teachers often deter their continued education.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smile-foundation-s-work-for-children-of-gaddi-tribe"><strong>Smile Foundation’s work for children of Gaddi tribe</strong></h2>



<p>Smile Foundation’s <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Mission Education</a> programme is designed to address precisely these challenges. With a focus on first-generation learners, the programme supports children from underserved communities by providing access to quality education, nutrition, and a supportive learning environment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-residential-support-for-continuity"><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Residential support for continuity</strong></h3>



<p>In tribal areas like Kangra, Smile Foundation’s residential Mission Education Centre ensures that children like Shreya have a safe, nurturing space to live and learn. This continuity is critical for children from migratory families or those in fragile home situations. At the Kangra centre, students are just taught academic subjects, life skills, nutrition support, and mentorship.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-culturally-sensitive-education">2. <strong>Culturally sensitive education</strong></h3>



<p>The educators are trained to be sensitive to the local context. This includes respecting tribal dialects, celebrating local festivals, and incorporating traditional knowledge into learning, whether it’s folk stories, nature-based learning, or community values. Such an approach fosters trust and bridges the gap between home and school cultures.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-focus-on-girls-education">3. <strong>Focus on girls’ education</strong></h3>



<p>Recognising the unique barriers faced by tribal girls, Smile Foundation places special emphasis on gender inclusion. Girls at the Kangra centre receive mentorship, healthcare, and vocational training, helping them build confidence and aspire to careers and leadership roles previously considered out of reach.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-ripple-effect-of-educating-tribal-children"><strong>The ripple effect of educating tribal children</strong></h2>



<p>The benefits of educating tribal children extend beyond the individual. They transform families, uplift communities, and contribute to national development in multiple ways.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-economic-empowerment">1. <strong>Economic Empowerment</strong></h3>



<p>An educated child contributes to household income, delays early marriage (especially for girls), and becomes more likely to participate in the formal workforce. They are also better equipped to access government schemes and resources meant for tribal welfare.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-health-and-social-development"><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Health and social development</strong></h3>



<p>Educated children grow into informed adults who understand healthcare, nutrition, sanitation, and child-rearing practices. This leads to healthier families and reduced maternal and infant mortality in tribal regions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-preserving-and-promoting-tribal-identity"><strong>3. Preserving and promoting tribal identity</strong></h3>



<p>Education does not have to mean cultural erasure. On the contrary, when children are taught to take pride in their roots, they become custodians of their language, crafts, and traditions. Smile Foundation actively encourages tribal children to explore their heritage while building the skills they need for modern life.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-strengthening-social-equity"><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Strengthening social equity</strong></h3>



<p>By investing in tribal education, India takes a firm step toward reducing historical inequalities. It signals that every child, regardless of geography or background, deserves an equal opportunity to learn, grow, and succeed.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shreya-s-dream-our-shared-responsibility"><strong>Shreya&#8217;s dream, our shared responsibility</strong></h2>



<p>Back in Kangra, Shreya’s eyes light up when she talks about her future. She dreams of becoming a teacher, so she can return to her village and help more children find the courage to study. “When I become a teacher, I’ll tell every girl she can do anything,” she says.</p>



<p>Her dream is not just hers to carry. It is ours to support.</p>



<p>Smile Foundation’s work with the Gaddi tribe and other indigenous communities showcases what is possible when grassroots education is backed with vision, resources, and compassion. But to scale this impact, we need collective action.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-create-long-term-interventions"><strong>How to create long-term interventions</strong></h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Invest in community-based education</strong>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In June, a class XII student from Uttar Pradesh’s Barabanki district, Pooja, participated in Japan’s prestigious Sakura Science High School Programme. Pooja invented a dust-free thresher that blocks agricultural dust emitted from wheat farms and provides clean air. The daughter of a labourer, Pooja is the only participant from UP to participate in the programme organised by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST). Despite her humble background, she had a breakthrough in her invention when she was in class VIII itself. She received both state and national recognition under INSPIRE awards. This is the actual power of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). Pooja is an ideal example of how STEM labs are nurturing creativity, critical thinking, and innovation among students.</p>



<p>Walk into a modern STEM lab in any progressive Indian school and you won’t find rows of silent desks or rote memorisation. Instead, you’ll see students huddled around 3D printers, experimenting with circuits, or programming miniature robots to navigate a maze. STEM labs are reimagining what education looks like in the 21st century, turning passive learning into active exploration.</p>



<p>In times where the future of work is being shaped by artificial intelligence, automation, and technological disruption, the traditional education model no longer suffices. India needs a generation of thinkers, builders, and problem-solvers—skills that cannot be taught through textbooks alone. This is where STEM labs come in. These dynamic, hands-on environments foster creativity, critical thinking, and real-world application, positioning students not just to adapt to the future but to shape it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-promise-of-a-stem-lab"><strong>The promise of a STEM lab</strong></h2>



<p>A STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) lab is a dynamic, hands-on learning environment that rewards curiosity, collaboration, and real-world problem-solving. Unlike traditional classrooms, which often emphasise rote learning, STEM labs allow students to build, test, code, and experiment—providing a tangible connection between theory and application. This approach cultivates critical 21st-century skills, including innovation, analytical thinking, and teamwork.</p>



<p>These spaces more than hubs of scientific explorations are incubators of confidence. Children are writing algorithms, building robots, and simulating climate models. This interdisciplinary framework helps young learners see how knowledge converges to shape the world around them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-coding-the-new-literacy"><strong>Coding: The new literacy</strong></h3>



<p>In today’s AI-driven world, coding is no longer a niche skill; it is foundational. Like reading and writing, coding enables people to make sense of their environment—in this case, the digital environment. Whether it&#8217;s writing a basic Python script, debugging a web app, or using Scratch to animate a story, coding gives students the ability to think in structured, logical ways.</p>



<p>More importantly, learning to code early in life helps demystify technology. AI may be writing code, but humans are still steering its purpose and ethics. When taught in a STEM lab setting, coding becomes a tool for creativity and exploration. Students apply their logic to build games, control sensors, or automate models, receiving instant feedback that sharpens their skills. The result is a generation of learners who don’t fear technology but shape it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-robotics-engineering-in-motion"><strong>Robotics: Engineering in motion</strong></h3>



<p>If coding is the brain, robotics is the body. Robotics education represents the seamless integration of mechanical engineering, electronics, and computer programming. It translates abstract STEM concepts into real-world functions. From automating agriculture to managing warehouse logistics and even conducting surgeries, robotics is revolutionising industries.</p>



<p>In STEM labs, students assemble kits, program microcontrollers, and troubleshoot movement sequences. These activities teach resilience, systems thinking, and real-time problem-solving. As students see their robotic creations perform tasks, it not only boosts their technical knowledge but also their confidence to innovate. In effect, they learn how technology can serve humanity’s evolving needs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-curiosity-the-engine-of-discovery"><strong>Curiosity: The engine of discovery</strong></h3>



<p>At the heart of any STEM education initiative lies curiosity. The freedom to ask &#8220;What if?&#8221; and &#8220;Why not?&#8221; is what separates passive learners from innovators. STEM labs encourage inquiry-led learning, where mistakes are seen as steps toward discovery. This openness fosters grit and a love for experimentation—two qualities vital for both academic and personal growth.</p>



<p>In such an environment, students learn to view challenges as puzzles and develop the capacity to iterate solutions. Whether they’re 3D-printing bridge models, designing solar cars, or programming AI chatbots, the emphasis is on learning by doing. STEM labs thus lay the psychological groundwork for entrepreneurship, scientific inquiry, and ethical leadership.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-government-push-for-stem-policy-backing-innovation"><strong>Government push for STEM: Policy backing innovation</strong></h2>



<p>Recognising the power of STEM, the Indian government has launched several impactful initiatives:</p>



<p><strong>Atal Tinkering Labs (ATLs)</strong>: Over 10,000 labs across 722 districts have been set up under the Atal Innovation Mission, reaching 1.1 crore students and leading to over 16 lakh innovation projects. These labs focus on 21st-century skills like design thinking, ethical leadership, and collaboration.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="677" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-12-1024x677.png" alt="" class="wp-image-13965" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-12-1024x677.png 1024w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-12-300x198.png 300w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-12-768x508.png 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-12.png 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Virtual Science Labs (CSIR Jigyasa)</strong>: Launched in 2021, this initiative offers 1,590+ web-enabled experiments across disciplines such as biotechnology, electronics, and physical sciences. Over 14 lakh students have accessed these labs, democratising scientific research exposure.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="684" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-11-1024x684.png" alt="" class="wp-image-13966" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-11-1024x684.png 1024w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-11-300x200.png 300w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-11-768x513.png 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-11.png 1168w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>These initiatives reflect a systemic shift in India’s education policy, from content-heavy curricula to curiosity-driven learning.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smile-foundation-s-contribution"><strong>Smile Foundation&#8217;s contribution</strong></h3>



<p>While policy drives scale, implementation on the ground requires trusted partners. Smile Foundation has been at the forefront of democratising STEM education, especially for underserved communities.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="677" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-10-1024x677.png" alt="" class="wp-image-13967" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-10-1024x677.png 1024w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-10-300x198.png 300w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-10-768x508.png 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-10.png 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-lies-ahead-scaling-impact"><strong>What lies ahead: Scaling impact</strong></h2>



<p>India’s STEM future rests on how effectively it can scale such interventions. The goal is not just to create coders or roboticists but to cultivate problem-solvers and ethical technologists. For this, a multi-pronged approach is needed:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Public-private partnerships</strong>: Scaling high-quality STEM labs requires investment, expertise, and local understanding. Collaborations like that of Smile Foundation and BMW India Foundation set a strong precedent.</li>



<li><strong>Curriculum integration</strong>: STEM must not remain an after-school activity. It needs to be embedded into mainstream curricula, aligned with national education goals like NEP 2020.</li>



<li><strong>Gender inclusion</strong>: STEM must actively dismantle gender biases. This means inclusive innovation clubs, mentorship for girls, and culturally rooted interventions.</li>



<li><strong>Capacity building</strong>: Teachers remain the cornerstone. Ongoing training, mentorship, and performance support must be prioritised to sustain quality.</li>



<li><strong>Tech accessibility</strong>: With emerging tools like AI, AR/VR, and IoT entering classrooms, infrastructure and digital equity need urgent attention to avoid deepening the education divide.</li>
</ul>



<p>A well-equipped STEM lab is a mindset incubator. In such spaces, children learn to question, design, fail, and try again. They understand that science is not a set of answers but a method of asking better questions. India’s investment in STEM labs, when combined with inclusive implementation models like Smile Foundation’s, holds the potential to turn its vast demographic dividend into a generation of innovators and problem-solvers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/1750044615752-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13964" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/1750044615752-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/1750044615752-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/1750044615752-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/1750044615752-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/1750044615752.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bridging-stem-gaps-policy-meets-csr"><strong>Bridging STEM gaps &#8211; Policy meets CSR</strong></h2>



<p>The Government of India has established a robust policy environment to strengthen STEM education, recognising its role in national development and global competitiveness. Key schemes include <strong>Rashtriya Avishkar Abhiyan</strong>, which integrates STEM learning with experiential methods in schools;<em> </em><strong>Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research (INSPIRE) </strong>which nurtures scientific talent from an early age and <strong>Digital India</strong> which promotes digital literacy and e-learning tools, enhancing STEM access in rural and semi-urban areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, initiatives like <strong>Atal Innovation Mission and PM eVIDYA </strong>support innovation labs, teacher training and digital content development. These programmes provide the policy infrastructure for corporate social responsibility initiatives to scale their impact through strategic public-private partnerships.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, despite several initiatives to make STEM education accessible in India, the gaps still exist. In low-resource communities, be it from Mumbai slums or remote Himalayan villages, many children look forward to learning, to questioning and to creating. But because of the lack of basic resources, trained teachers and hands on experiences their potential goes unrealised.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-is-stem-education-vital"><strong>Why is STEM education vital?</strong></h3>



<p>STEM careers are poised for exceptional growth, driven by rapid technological advancement and the global push towards digitalisation, sustainability, and innovation. According to the <a href="https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20245/u-s-stem-workforce-size-growth-and-employment" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> and the <a href="https://reports.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_Report_2025.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">World Economic Forum</a>, STEM jobs are projected to grow by 6.9% between 2022 and 2032 outpacing non-STEM roles. </p>
