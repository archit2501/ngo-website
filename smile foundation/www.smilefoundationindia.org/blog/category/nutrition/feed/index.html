<p>India’s remarkable strides in maternal care and infant health paint a hopeful picture. The <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2112476" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Maternal</a><a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2112476" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"> </a><a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2112476" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Mortality Ratio</a> (MMR) has fallen from 130 to 97 per 100,000 live births. Neonatal and infant mortality rates have also dropped significantly—by 65% and 69% respectively—surpassing global averages. Yet behind these promising statistics lies a sobering reality of India&#8217;s rural maternal care system.</p>



<p>Each number represents a mother—often rural, frequently impoverished, and too often unheard. Her journey through pregnancy and childbirth is far more than a biological event.  Such scenarios reflect that we are going through a test of strength of our maternal care system in rural India, the equity of our social structures, and the depth of our collective compassion, and we have a long way to go.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rituals of care – More than cultural symbols</strong></h2>



<p>In rural India, baby showers, known by various names like <em>Godh Bharai, Seemantham, Shaad, or Dohale Jevan</em>, are threads in a communal safety net. These traditions embody emotional, spiritual, and nutritional support for the expectant mother.</p>



<p>In North India’s <em>Godh Bharai</em>, blessings, music, and festive meals offer joy and reassurance. South India’s <em>Seemantham</em> celebrates the mother with bangles believed to emit vibrations that calm the unborn child. In Eastern and Western regions, food, music, and community love are central to ceremonies like <em>Shaad</em> and <em>Dohale Jevan</em>.</p>



<p>Beyond their spiritual richness, these events reduce maternal stress, reinforce support networks, and provide emotional grounding—essentials for a safe pregnancy. The shared wisdom from older women, nourishing foods, and joyful celebrations help prepare her mentally and physically for childbirth and motherhood. Such ceremonies also mark a shift in the mother’s role, affirming her importance and care within the family. </p>



<p>This emotional reassurance, combined with social and nutritional support, contributes to better maternal <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1453" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> and can positively impact the baby’s development. In essence, these age-old customs are deeply rooted systems of community care that foster resilience, wellbeing, and healthy beginnings.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The gaps in rural maternal healthcare</strong></h3>



<p>India’s efforts to improve maternal health have yielded significant progress. Since 1990, the country has witnessed an <a href="https://mohfw.gov.in/?q=pressreleasetb-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">83% decline in its Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)</a>, a testament to national policy interventions and improved service delivery under frameworks like the National Health Mission. However, behind these promising statistics lies a more complex and uneven reality—particularly in rural India.</p>



<p>Critical complications such as excessive bleeding (postpartum haemorrhage), sepsis, pregnancy-induced hypertension, obstructed labour, and unsafe abortions continue to claim the lives of countless women, especially those in underserved regions. The persistence of these largely preventable causes underscores that while healthcare systems have expanded, their reach, reliability, and equity remain insufficient.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Awareness: What she doesn’t know can hurt her</strong></h3>



<p>Lack of awareness remains a major barrier to accessing maternal healthcare in India. Many women are unaware of the importance of antenatal check-ups (ANC), resulting in missed opportunities for early detection of complications. Among currently pregnant women, only 30% had three or more ANC visits, while 27% had none. Even among lactating women, 18% reported zero ANC visits. In Punjab, NFHS-4 data shows just 67.8% of women received four ANC visits. These figures underline the urgent need for targeted awareness campaigns to promote consistent, informed engagement with maternal and child health services.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Affordability: Confronting the cost of survival</strong></h3>



<p>For many rural families, maternal health is a financial compromise. The inability to afford nutritious food, travel for medical check-ups, or private consultations leads to delayed care and preventable complications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore<strong>, </strong>women delay antenatal check-ups or give birth at home, not by choice—but because they simply cannot afford the journey to a clinic, the tests, or even a nutritious meal. With no financial cushion, families often choose between food and healthcare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The absence of affordable iron supplements, fresh vegetables, or hygiene essentials leaves mothers dangerously malnourished and anemic. The result is a cycle of poor maternal outcomes passed down across generations because health becomes a luxury only few can buy.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Accessibility: When care is far, risks grow near</strong></h3>



<p>In rural India, many expectant mothers face the harsh reality of travelling several kilometres—often on unpaved roads or via scarce public transport—to access even basic healthcare. These delays can prove fatal, especially during labour or pregnancy-related emergencies. The absence of reliable transport systems and referral mechanisms further compounds the risk. Sub-centres and primary health centres, intended as frontline providers of maternal care, are frequently understaffed, under-equipped, or entirely non-existent. Without skilled birth attendants and timely access to essential medicines and diagnostic tools, treatable complications like haemorrhage, eclampsia, and infections become deadly. The distance to care becomes a life-threatening gap.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Availability: Geography and broken systems block the path to care</strong></h3>



<p>A mother in a remote village may walk miles for a blood pressure check, or worse, never go at all. Healthcare is often distant and sporadic, with clinics understaffed or unreachable. Mobile medical vans are rare, and even when available, they may not return soon enough. Anganwadi workers, often the only hope for health <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2457" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a>, are stretched thin.</p>



<p>The lack of timely screenings or follow-ups can turn a manageable condition into a fatal one. For these women, distance and delay can be the difference between life and death.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Intersecting Inequities</strong></h3>



<p>These three barriers do not operate in isolation. Rather, their intersection deepens existing socio-economic divides. Data consistently shows that <a href="https://www.prb.org/resources/maternal-care-in-india-reveals-gaps-between-urban-and-rural-rich-and-poor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">utilisation of maternal healthcare services</a>—both antenatal and postnatal—varies sharply based on income, caste, education, and geography. Women from lower-income or marginalised communities are significantly less likely to receive skilled care during childbirth, contributing to disproportionate maternal health outcomes.</p>



<p>Moreover, the absence of skilled healthcare workers at the time of delivery remains a persistent challenge. Without trained personnel to guide safe births and manage complications, the goal of ensuring every mother a safe pregnancy remains unmet in large parts of the country. In sum, the journey towards maternal health equity in rural India requires more than infrastructure—it demands a transformation of systems, mindsets, and investments that address the <strong>availability, accessibility, and affordability</strong> of care for every woman.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Community care in action with Swabhiman</strong></h2>



<p>Our initiatives directly involve pregnant women, lactating mothers, caregivers, and children through awareness, counselling, and interactive sessions. We aim at driving behavioral change around nutrition and health practices for women within her community. In the financial year of  2024, <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/women-empowerment/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Swabhiman</a></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Reached <strong>190,000+ women</strong> across 6 states</li>



<li>Sensitised <strong>76,000+ women</strong> on reproductive and child health</li>



<li>Provided healthcare to <strong>72,000+ women and children</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Stakeholder &amp; community engagements</strong></h3>



<p>Sustainable change in maternal and child health initiatives begins with effective collaboration among key stakeholders. Regular interface meetings are held with Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI) members, government officials, and representatives from various sectors such as education, health, and local governance.</p>



<p><strong>Key Initiatives and Community Involvement</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Community Kitchen Gardens:<br></strong>To improve nutritional intake, 22 community kitchen gardens were established, providing beneficiaries with locally grown vegetables such as bottle gourd, tomatoes, and pumpkins.<br></li>



<li><strong>Observing Special Days:<br></strong>Key health and nutrition-related days such as Women’s Day, Breastfeeding Week ,and POSHAN MAH  were observed with awareness campaigns, screening camps, recipe competitions, and educational sessions. These events aimed to educate women and caregivers on proper nutrition and maternal care practices.<br></li>



<li><strong>Breastfeeding Awareness Week:<br></strong>In partnership with ICDS and the PepsiCo Foundation, Smile Foundation organised breastfeeding demonstrations, emphasising the benefits of proper attachment and positioning. Awareness sessions educated caregivers on the importance of breastfeeding for both mother and child.<br></li>



<li><strong>Godh bharai and Annaprashan Diwas:<br></strong>Monthly events focused on maternal and child nutrition included Godh bharai for pregnant women, offering nutritional support and education, and Annaprashan for children starting complementary feeding. These celebrations provide vital community support and promote behaviour change in nutrition practices.<br></li>



<li><strong>POSHAN MAH Celebrations:<br></strong>Smile Foundation, along with ICDS and Education departments, organised nutrition recipe competitions, school-level activities, and kitchen garden initiatives during POSHAN MAH, enhancing community involvement and nutrition awareness.</li>
</ol>



<p>Through these initiatives, stakeholder collaboration and community participation continue to drive positive outcomes in maternal and child health.</p>



<p><strong>Nutrition is grown, served, and shared</strong></p>



<p>Nutrition and maternal care are not just delivered — they are cultivated, practised, and celebrated within the community. Nutrition is grown in kitchen gardens, served through local recipes, and shared via counselling, health camps, and regular screenings — ensuring year-round wellbeing for mothers and children.</p>



<p><strong>Growing nutrition inside homes</strong></p>



<p>132 kitchen gardens were set up at Anganwadi centres and homes, including 3 community gardens, using distributed winter vegetable seeds. This ensured access to fresh produce for daily use and nutrition events. The Education Department expanded the model to 21 schools through district and NRLM support.</p>



<p><strong>Learning through recipes<br></strong>Inter-village recipe contests engaged 151 women and caregivers, showcasing healthy, affordable dishes using local ingredients. Judged by officials, the contests promoted practical nutrition and honoured winners at the district level.</p>



<p><strong>Counselling and Follow-Up<br></strong>Regular follow-ups were conducted for anaemic and malnourished women, with ASHAs, Anganwadi workers, and community staff offering focused counselling and timely referrals to strengthen maternal health outcomes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>PARTNER FOR COMMUNITY-LED TRANSFORMATION</strong></h3>



<p>Maternal care in India is at a pivotal moment. While national data reflects progress, the ground reality in rural areas demands deeper, more inclusive interventions. It is not merely about improving statistics but transforming lives.</p>



<p>The Swabhiman programme offers a blueprint for community-led, sustainable maternal health solutions. Its success is rooted in collective action—from mothers and caregivers to local officials and frontline workers.</p>



<p>CSR partnerships have the potential to amplify this impact manifold. By aligning business resources with community health goals, companies can co-create meaningful change—ensuring a robust maternal care in across India, including the remotest corners because every mother receives the care, dignity, and support she deserves.</p>



<p>This Mother&#8217;s Day,<a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"> partner to scale community reach</a>. Let’s make care meet for rural mothers of India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a country where 253 million adolescents—the largest adolescent population in the world—are navigating the most formative phase of their lives, nutrition is a development imperative moving beyond the margins of a health issue. When we talk about transforming India’s future, we must start by nourishing it—especially the girls.</p>



<p>Yet, the numbers tell a different story. According to Smile Foundation’s baseline study in Banaskantha, Gujarat,&nbsp;<strong>78% of adolescent girls were anaemic</strong>, with 50% suffering from moderate anaemia and 13% facing severe deficiency. This isn’t an isolated case—it reflects the national trend, where&nbsp;<strong>56% of Indian adolescent girls are anaemic</strong>, as per UNICEF. These girls are not just individuals grappling with fatigue, irregular periods, or developmental delays. They are India’s potential scientists, teachers, farmers, entrepreneurs—building blocks of a nation trying to find its demographic dividend.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why adolescent nutrition matters more than ever</strong></h2>



<p>Adolescence is the second most critical window in human development after early childhood. Nutritional interventions during this phase can permanently alter cognitive ability, reproductive <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1451" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a>, academic performance, and economic productivity. Unfortunately, adolescent girls—especially those from rural or marginalized communities—are often invisible in health and policy frameworks. They eat last. They eat least.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Nutrition Enhancement Programme</strong>&nbsp;led by Smile Foundation in Amirgarh block of Banaskantha district is a powerful model of what works when adolescent health is taken seriously. Targeting over 1,000 girls (aged 14–19), the project tackled not just anaemia, but also food diversity, hygiene, menstrual health, and self-esteem—components that are too often treated in silos.</p>



<p>The programme’s multi-pronged approach involved:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Distribution of&nbsp;64,896 iron and folic acid (IFA) tablets</li>



<li>Weekly&nbsp;distribution of over 130,000 laddoos&nbsp;fortified with essential nutrients</li>



<li>Establishment of&nbsp;617 community and 397 individual kitchen gardens</li>



<li>Distribution of 18,912 sanitary napkin packets</li>



<li>Over&nbsp;4,700 home visits&nbsp;and&nbsp;1,000+ meetings&nbsp;with frontline health workers</li>



<li>Skills training&nbsp;in sewing, baking, and food processing for 300+ girls</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>These are investments in human dignity, delayed motherhood, greater school attendance, and a community that starts seeing its girls as assets, not burdens.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The local lens: What Banaskantha taught us</strong></h2>



<p>Banaskantha is the second-largest district in Gujarat, with&nbsp;<strong>7.7% of girls aged 15–19 already mothers or pregnant</strong>. In one of the most integrated community-led campaigns in the region, 1110 <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2456" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> sessions were held on nutrition, hygiene, reproductive health, and self-care. The topics were adapted with cultural sensitivity and delivered by trained peer educators and local NGOs.</p>



<p>A key insight from the programme was that&nbsp;<strong>only 17.6% of girls were attending school</strong>, and most dropped out after Class 6 or 8. Many had never heard of anaemia, let alone been tested for it. By distributing IFA tablets and educating girls about their purpose, Smile Foundation turned pill consumption from a “suspicious” act into an empowering daily habit. A mother, during a focus group discussion, said: “We were told the tablets would make them infertile. Now we know they’re making them stronger.”</p>



<p><strong>Menstrual hygiene</strong>—long cloaked in silence—also emerged as a public health success. Even girls who had not attended sessions began using sanitary napkins after mothers were sensitized. School absenteeism during menstruation dropped. So did the hours girls spent collecting water and performing household chores—liberating them, quite literally, to learn and grow.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The global context: What the world can learn from Banaskantha</strong></h2>



<p>Globally, nutrition is having a renaissance moment. The&nbsp;<strong>Lancet Series on Adolescent Health</strong>&nbsp;calls this group the “pivot generation”—simultaneously inheriting and shaping future health trends. Interventions at this age have been proven to yield&nbsp;a 10x return on investment&nbsp;in terms of life outcomes.</p>



<p>In Kenya, the “Nourishing Minds” programme combines school meals with reproductive health education, seeing a 20% increase in school retention. In Peru, a conditional cash transfer model linked to iron-rich food baskets and mother-daughter check-ins helped halve anaemia rates in rural regions. And, in Bangladesh, BRAC’s adolescent clubs serve as nutrition hubs and safe spaces—building agency and awareness through peer learning.</p>



<p>What makes Banaskantha’s case unique is that it combines&nbsp;<strong>IFA supplementation with food-based approaches</strong>&nbsp;like laddoo distribution and kitchen gardens respecting local dietary practices and leveraging them for systemic change.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Development as dignity, not charity</strong></h2>



<p>If there’s one thing Smile Foundation’s work underscores, it’s this: development must be about restoring choice and voice, not just delivering services. It’s why community engagement was baked into every layer of the programme—from training&nbsp;<strong>36 peer educator groups</strong>, to conducting&nbsp;<strong>180 cooking competitions</strong>, to creating&nbsp;<strong>367 healthy recipes</strong>&nbsp;with locally sourced ingredients.</p>



<p>In development circles, we often discuss “scalability” as if communities are homogenous. Banaskantha reminds us that&nbsp;<strong>scaling isn’t about replication—it’s about adaptation</strong>. What works in Gujarat might need different tools in Assam or Uttar Pradesh. But the core principle holds true: when adolescent girls are nourished—in body, mind, and spirit—they break generational cycles of poverty, malnutrition, and gender inequality.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The way forward: Systems, not slogans</strong></h2>



<p>India has made impressive strides through programmes like Poshan Abhiyaan and Anaemia Mukt Bharat. But without adolescent-specific frameworks, the cycle of undernutrition will continue. According to NFHS-5,&nbsp;<strong>45% of girls aged 15–18 still have a BMI below 18.5</strong>, and many don’t know why their energy, periods, or growth feel “off.”</p>



<p>Smile Foundation’s Banaskantha model has the potential to inform national policy on three fronts:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Integration</strong>: Embed adolescent nutrition within school curriculums and community health efforts.</li>



<li><strong>Gender sensitivity</strong>: Treat girls not as passive recipients but co-creators—training them as educators, entrepreneurs, and health ambassadors.</li>



<li><strong>Measurement</strong>: Use behaviour indicators (school attendance, self-efficacy, menstrual hygiene) alongside biometric outcomes to track change.</li>
</ol>



<p>If we want to reap our demographic dividend, we must first nourish it. And that nourishment must begin long before a girl becomes a woman or a mother. It must begin when she begins to imagine who she could be.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>149.2 million children aged below five years are stunted (short for their age) and 45.4 million are wasted (underweight for their height) across the globe. The World Health Organization (WHO) reveals that over three-quarters of children suffering from wasting live in Asia. WHO also estimates that over 47% of children below five years are anemic, and 38.9 million children are overweight across the world. About 45% of deaths among children below five years are linked to undernutrition. Not just the deaths, stunt, wasted, anemia, and other issues are also closely related to nutrition deficiencies. Before we go on to discuss its causes and ways to overcome it, let’s understand the importance of a healthy diet and WHO’s recommendations on maintaining a healthy diet.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Importance of a healthy diet</strong></h2>



<p>A healthy diet is incredibly important for children as it lays the foundation for their growth, development, and overall <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1427" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a>. Proper nutrition ensures that children get the essential vitamins, minerals, protein, fats, and carbohydrates needed to support their physical, cognitive, and emotional development. Below is a breakdown of why a healthy diet is so crucial for children.</p>



<p><strong>1. Physical growth and development:</strong> A balanced diet with nutrients like calcium, protein, and vitamin D helps in the proper formation of bones, muscles, and organs, ensuring children grow at a healthy rate. Also, it provides the necessary energy for children to stay active throughout the day, supporting both physical activity and cognitive function. Carbohydrates are a key source of energy for children, fueling everything from running and playing to concentrating in school.</p>



<p><strong>2. Building immune system:</strong> A healthy diet helps children in building a strong immune system, reducing the risk of illnesses and infections. Nutrients like vitamin A, vitamin C, and zinc support the body’s ability to fight off sickness and maintain overall health.</p>



<p><strong>3. Reduced risk of chronic diseases:</strong> A balanced diet with limited processed foods and high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can lower the risk of developing chronic health issues later in life, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease.</p>



<p><strong>4. Regulation of sleep:</strong> A balanced diet helps maintain healthy sleep patterns. Foods rich in magnesium, tryptophan, and serotonin-boosting amino acids can promote restful sleep, which is essential for growth, learning, and mood regulation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>WHO recommendation on maintaining a healthy diet</strong></h2>



<p>One of the significant factors of a healthy diet is its diversity. For it helps to meet essential nutrients’ requirements of individuals. For children aged between 6 and 23 months, the WHO has set up a set of guidelines to include minimum dietary diversity in their meals. It is the consumption of four or more food groups from the seven recommended food groups. The recommended food groups are-</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>grains, roots, and tubers</li>



<li>legumes and nuts</li>



<li>dairy products</li>



<li>flesh foods (meat, fish, poultry, and organ meats)</li>



<li>eggs</li>



<li>vitamin-A-rich fruits and vegetables</li>



<li>fruits and vegetables</li>
</ol>



<p>It means that a child is most likely to consume at least one animal-source food and at least one fruit or vegetable in addition to a staple food in a day. By consuming adequately diversified food, one can improve intake of nutrients. It in turn will lead to better nutritional status. In addition, below are some of the recommendations on maintaining a healthy diet.</p>



<p><strong>1. Fruits and vegetables:</strong> WHO recommends an intake of at least 400 g or five portions of fruits and vegetables in a day. It will help to ensure an adequate daily intake of dietary fiber. Intake of vegetables and fruits can be improved by</p>



<p>a. Including vegetables in all meals.</p>



<p>b. Consuming raw vegetables and fruits as snacks.</p>



<p>c. Consuming a variety of fruits and vegetables, especially seasonal fruits.</p>



<p><strong>2. Fats:</strong> It is advisable to limit total fat intake to less than 30% of total energy. This will prevent unhealthy weight gain. In order to reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases, one needs to reduce saturated fats to less than 10% of total energy intake and trans fats to less than 1% of total energy intake. WHO recommends replacing both saturated and trans fats with polyunsaturated fats. Consumption of fats can be improved by</p>



<p>a. Switching to boiling and steaming instead of deep frying.</p>



<p>b. Replacing butter, ghee, and lard with oils rich in polyunsaturated fats like soybean, corn, safflower, and sunflower oils.</p>



<p>c.&nbsp;Consuming lean meats and reduced-fat dairy foods.</p>



<p>d. Removing visible fat from meat.</p>



<p>e. Limiting consumption of baked, fried, and other processed foods.</p>



<p><strong>3. Salt, sodium, and potassium:</strong> According to research, reducing salt intake to less than 5 grams per day could prevent at least 1.7 million deaths in a year. In general, people consume too much sodium through salt and a lesser amount of potassium. This is one of the reasons for high blood pressure, which in turn increases the risk of stroke and heart diseases. Salt intake can be reduced by</p>



<p>a. Limiting consumption of salty snacks.</p>



<p>b. Choosing edible items with lower sodium content.</p>



<p>c. Limiting the amount of salt and other sodium condiments while preparing foods.</p>



<p>Similarly, potassium—which is capable of mitigating negative effects of increased sodium consumption on blood pressure—can be increased by consuming fresh fruits and vegetables.</p>



<p><strong>4. Sugars:</strong> The recommended level of sugar intake in a day is less than 10% of total energy intake. Reducing it further to less than 5% of total energy intake would provide additional health benefits, according to experts. Increased sugar consumption leads to dental caries, unhealthy weight gain leading to overweight and obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. Sugar intake can be reduced by</p>



<p>a. Consuming fresh fruits and raw vegetables.</p>



<p>b. Avoiding consumption of foods and drinks with high amounts of sugars.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Link between healthy diet and academic performance</strong></h2>



<p>Over a period of time, multiple studies have established the direct connection between diet and academic performance of students. The diet of a person can have a direct impact on their cognitive function, energy levels, mental health, and overall well-being.</p>



<p><strong>1. Improved cognitive function:</strong> A diet that is rich with complex carbohydrates like whole grains, vegetables, and legumes releases glucose steadily into the bloodstream, fueling the brain for a long period. This steady supply of glucose is vital for maintaining focus, memory, and mental performance of students. In contrast, diets high in refined sugars and simple carbohydrates can cause blood sugar spikes and crashes. It in turn will negatively affect the cognitive performance, mood, and attention of students.</p>



<p>Inclusion of antioxidants like berries is associated with improved memory and learning abilities. These antioxidants will protect the brain from oxidative stress. Similarly, inclusion of healthy fats like omega-3 fatty acids supports cognitive functions like memory, concentration, and problem-solving abilities, and improves brain plasticity. Polyphenols, commonly found in tea, dark chocolate, and red grapes, are found to enhance memory and learning by stimulating the growth of brain cells in the hippocampus.</p>



<p>Certain amino acids found in protein-rich foods like lean meats, nuts, and eggs are utilized by the brain to produce neurotransmitters that regulate mood, cognition, and memory.</p>



<p>Nutrients like iron and zinc are vital for maintaining brain function. While iron helps to carry oxygen to the brain, zinc supports neurotransmitter function and protects the brain from oxidative damage. These minerals ensure that the brain gets the oxygen and nutrients it needs to operate efficiently.</p>



<p><strong>2. Improved mood regulation:</strong> A healthy diet supports mood regulation because of their influence on multiple neurotransmitters. A diet rich in tryptophan helps to maintain optimal serotonin levels—the feel-good neurotransmitter—regulating mood, appetite, and sleep. Similarly, diets rich in tyrosine and phenylalanine support dopamine production, helping to boost motivation and improve mood. Diets rich in tyrosine help with the synthesis of norepinephrine, supporting mood regulation and stress management.</p>



<p>Deficiencies in certain vitamins and minerals can negatively affect mood and mental health. B vitamins, especially B6, B12, and B9, are crucial for the production and function of neurotransmitters. Deficiencies in these vitamins are associated with symptoms of depression, irritability, and anxiety. Foods like leafy greens, beans, eggs, and fortified cereals are rich in B vitamins and help maintain mental stability.</p>



<p>Magnesium is known for its role in regulating mood and stress levels. It has a calming effect on the nervous system and helps reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. Magnesium-rich foods include dark leafy greens, nuts, seeds, and whole grains.</p>



<p>Low levels of vitamin D have been linked to mood disorders like depression. Vitamin D helps regulate serotonin levels, and sunlight exposure or foods like fortified dairy and fatty fish can boost vitamin D levels, improving mood.</p>



<p>When students consume a nutritious diet, their cognitive ability will improve and their mood will stabilize in addition to their physical well-being. This in turn will ensure that students attend their classes regularly without taking leaves. Reduction in absenteeism will ensure significant improvement in their academic performance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smile Foundation’s work in Child Nutrition and Education</strong></h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good health is a fundamental human right and an essential need for all. It holds particular significance for women, especially those in rural areas. In rural India, women not only bear the responsibility of caring for their children and families while managing household chores, but they also play a crucial role in the labour force and agriculture. Their active participation contributes to family income, national development, and the agricultural sector.</p>



<p>The impact of nutrition on their <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1414" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> is not only vital for their well-being but also has a ripple effect on their families and broader economic activities. Poor health resulting from inadequate nutrition diminishes their ability to care for their families and significantly reduces their earning potential. An inadequate intake of nutrients could lead to malnutrition and deficiency diseases, and make women prone to certain ailments. Lower health status manifests itself in:</p>



<p>a) lower life expectancy,</p>



<p>b) higher rates of morbidity and mortality,</p>



<p>c) lower levels of productivity, and</p>



<p>d) a decreased ability to earn and support</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Nutrition deficiency impact&#8217;s on rural women</strong></h2>



<p>While maternal morbidity and several women-related health challenges arising due to nutrition deficiency remain a global challenge, for rural women, the effects are disproportionate. Patriarchal social structure, illiteracy, unskilled labour, financial dependence, gender discrimination, early marriage and multiple pregnancies, hard physical labour, lack of awareness and access to safe healthcare, and poverty<em> </em>are only a few factors that largely rule the lives of rural women.</p>



<p>All of these factors hinder their access to proper intake of nutrition which are again exacerbated by pregnancy-related issues and other reproductive health issues and while this continues, it also restricts them to the four walls of their house, restricting their financial mobility- creating a vicious cycle of poor nutrition, health, and economic dependence.</p>



<p>The impact of nutritional deficiency among rural women is far-reaching.</p>



<p>Here are a few:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Low weight and height:</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>The majority of young women from lower socioeconomic groups suffer from undernutrition, primarily as a result of these communities&#8217; females not fulfilling their nutritional needs as they enter puberty. This subsequently, leads to low body weight and stunted height, unable to grow to their full potential. Malnutrition impairs the healthy development of the pelvis and causes stunted growth. By the time a girl reaches adolescence, she still has around 4% of her height to gain and 12–18% of her pelvis to expand.</p>



<p>Further, teenage pregnancy and early marriage impede her growth. Therefore, these women are classified as &#8220;high risk&#8221; because they are more likely to experience obstetric problems and give birth to low birth weight (LBW) babies, which raises the possibility of higher infant mortality and morbidity.</p>



<p>2. <strong>Maternal mortality:</strong></p>



<p>Approximately 25% of maternal deaths worldwide are caused by pregnancy and stillbirth-related factors, which claim the lives of over 100,000 women in the nation, each year. According to the <a target="_blank" href="http://UN MMEIG 2020 report" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">UN MMEIG 2020 report,</a> <em>Trends in Maternal Mortality 2000 to 2020</em>, India’s MMR has significantly reduced from 384 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 103 in 2020. In comparison, the global MMR has decreased from 339 to 223 over the same period.</p>



<p>Haemorrhage (prenatal and postnatal), toxaemia (pregnancy-related hypertension), anaemia, obstructed labour, puerperal sepsis (postpartum infections), and botched abortion are the main causes of these deaths, which are doubled due to lack of proper nutrition intake.</p>



<p>For rural women, the burden of uncontrolled fertility, insufficient prenatal care, and a shortage of qualified delivery attendants act as a double whammy and become the primary causes of increased maternal mortality. The poor nutrition status of rural women doubled with the sociocultural attitudes and gender discrimination are indirectly linked to increasing mortality rate.</p>



<p>3. <strong>Anemia:</strong></p>



<p>Women have a higher need of iron than men and, are impacted disproportionately by a lack of proper nutrients. Anaemia is the most common nutritional deficiency seen among Indian women, especially those from the lower socio-economic groups,&nbsp; and the most common cause for it is the deficiency of iron and, to a lesser extent, folic acid. Iron is required essentially for the formulation of haemoglobin, which is the carrier of oxygen in our blood. This often causes shortness of breath, pale colour of eyes and nails and reduction in capacity to work.</p>



<p>The majority of women see a decline in haemoglobin levels as their pregnancy progresses, and pregnancy is a time of nutritional stress. Repeated pregnancies, blood loss during menstruation, poor diet, and a lack of iron supplements in rural women also affect the haemoglobin levels. Anaemia (RGI) bleeding during pregnancy and puerperium are thought to be responsible for 40% of all maternal fatalities in rural settings. The latter indirectly leads to death, but it also reflects the severe repercussions of nutritional deficiency in rural Indian health conditions.</p>



<p>Therefore, it is not too difficult to understand the rising numbers of malnutrition across the globe, both among women and children. Iron deficiency anaemia adversely affects maternal and foetal well-being and is linked to increased morbidity and foetal death. Infants and children with iron deficiency anaemia are at risk of developmental difficulties involving cognitive, social-emotional, and adaptive functions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Nutritional Development with Swabhiman</strong></h3>



<p>With the belief that women are the cornerstone of a community, Smile Foundation&#8217;s women empowerment initiative- <a target="_blank" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/women-empowerment/" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Swabhiman </a>works closely on the enhancement of maternal and reproductive healthcare of women their children and young girls.</p>



<p>One of the key elements of our program is to give the underserved women of India, the knowledge and adaptability of habits that enhance their nutritional development. Through regular awareness camps, practical activities and working hand-in-hand with Aanganwadi workers in India, Swabhiman supports the values and visions of the government towards women&#8217;s health in India.</p>



<p>For example, Smile Foundation organised an awareness camp in Greater Noida to mark the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=725466579604487&amp;set=pcb.725466679604477" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">&#8220;Rashtriya Poshan Maah celebration&#8221;</a> in partnership with our esteemed partners, where women of the community were provided with information and habits that improve the Antenatal Care (ANC) and the importance of maternal health and its connection to nutrition.</p>



<p>Swabhiman aims to be an accessible and affordable platform for rural women in India, empowering them with the knowledge and practices needed to overcome challenges such as<strong> nutritional deficiency</strong>. By fostering healthier lifestyles, Swabhiman not only enables women to lead better lives but also equips them to nurture their children and uplift their communities, promoting holistic growth and well-being.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In today’s world, it is common to see people walking or running to the gym, practicing intermittent fasting, or following popular diets to lose weight. This lifestyle stands in stark contrast to earlier patterns, where health typically became a priority only after the age of 40 or when a health issue arose. However, is that enough to maintain good health? Other factors such as managing stress, a nutritious diet, and overall lifestyle changes also play a crucial role in staying healthy. The excessive use of mobile phones is also impacting people’s mental and physical health.</p>



<p>Younger generations in India are increasingly adopting healthier lifestyles and becoming more health-conscious by following <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/information/story/why-young-indians-are-opting-for-healthier-food-choices-2442639-2023-09-30" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">nutritious eating habits</a> and engaging in regular exercise. Despite being more aware of their health than previous generations, there are still concerns regarding rising stress levels, mental health issues, and the prevalence of unhealthy food. These factors contribute to the growing incidence of lifestyle diseases. Women have varied issues at various stages that also often go unattended.</p>



<p>Being aware is one thing and implementing healthy habits and routines is another thing. Self-awareness enables us to recognise and respond to our physical and psychological needs in a timely manner. <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/3-ways-to-boost-longevity-in-2025" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">But, we must be motivated to create action plans to meet these basic needs</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rising Lifestyle Diseases</strong></h2>



<p>Lifestyle diseases are often associated with various lifestyle factors, including unhealthy diets, lack of physical activity, tobacco use, and excessive alcohol consumption. Cardiovascular diseases encompass conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, leading to heart attacks. There has been considerable debate about how the pandemic has impacted all aspects of human health along with the long-term consequences of the vaccine, particularly heart health. Regardless, it seems the pandemic has contributed to an increase in heart attacks to some extent. Alarmingly, the average age of patients with cardiac issues is decreasing each year.</p>



<p>Hypertension is a very common medical concern in India. Obesity is also increasingly affecting young children, youth, and adults. Factors contributing to this include sedentary lifestyles, lack of outdoor play, and unhealthy food and processed food.</p>



<p>Diabetes comes with a lot of challenges along with elevated blood sugar levels. It can lead to numerous other medical problems or exacerbate existing conditions such as heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and vision impairments. It may delay improvement in cases.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Chronic Respiratory Diseases</strong></h3>



<p>Indians are increasingly suffering from respiratory diseases due to co-morbidities and high pollution levels. Chest and throat diseases, often manifesting as pneumonia which can be life-threatening, are very common.</p>



<p><strong>Mental Health</strong></p>



<p>Recently, the incidence of mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse, etc., has significantly increased among Indians. The pandemic has played a substantial role in this rise, along with a lack of awareness and stigma towards mental health and limited access to mental healthcare.</p>



<p>This alarming trend in mental health concerns is closely linked to the intense performance demands and high expectations prevalent in various professional sectors and in academics. The consequences of such persistent stress are profound, negatively impacting not only individual mental and physical well-being but also reducing productivity in workplaces and schools/colleges. Furthermore, peer pressure, excessive internet use, and social media comparisons can worsen mental health issues, leading to feelings of inadequacy and unrealistic expectations.</p>



<p><strong>Women’s Health</strong></p>



<p>Though mental health and other lifestyle-related diseases also affect women, their health concerns are intricate and diverse. Throughout different life stages, women face various issues related to sexual and reproductive health, osteoporosis, and chronic conditions such as cancer and heart disease. Women often neglect their health, and this lack of attention is further perpetuated by others.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Positive Trends Towards Good Health</strong></h2>



<p>There are encouraging trends regarding health, particularly among young people. The youth can serve as role models for older generations and, as part of families, can encourage healthier habits among adults. Some positive practices that Indians are adopting and can promote include:</p>



<p><strong>Increased Health Awareness and Fitness Options:</strong> Young people are more informed about nutritional needs and actively seek healthier food choices. They prioritise regular exercise, take gym memberships, do yoga, and utilize home workout apps that are becoming increasingly popular. Health influencers on social media also promote good health and healthy eating habits.</p>



<p><strong>Access to Information:</strong> There is a wealth of health information available through technology, and social media plays a significant role in encouraging healthier lifestyle choices.</p>



<p><strong>Focus on Mental Health: </strong>Young individuals are more open to addressing stress and other mental health issues, often seeking counselling or therapy.</p>



<p><strong>Community Health Activities:</strong> Many young people participate in marathons, walking or cycling groups, and other outdoor adventures, which promote physical activity and social engagement.</p>



<p><strong>Preventive Healthcare:</strong> Youth are more aware of the importance of health check-ups and vaccinations, as well as understanding hereditary health risks.</p>



<p>In conclusion, while there is a growing awareness of health among young Indians, translating this awareness into actual practice is essential. A comprehensive focus on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg_GW7yhq20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">physical and mental health</a> is necessary to ensure overall well-being.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bridging Healthcare Gaps with Smile Foundation</strong></h3>



<p>Despite growing awareness of health and well-being, millions in India, especially women and children in underserved communities, still lack access to essential healthcare. Smile Foundation’s <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">healthcare programme</a> is committed to changing this by providing preventive, promotive, and curative healthcare services where they are needed most. Through initiatives like Smile on Wheels, we take primary healthcare to remote areas, ensuring that families receive timely medical attention, screenings, and awareness about lifestyle diseases, maternal health, and nutrition.</p>



<p>With the rise of lifestyle diseases, mental health concerns, and chronic conditions, healthcare must go beyond treatment—it must focus on prevention and awareness. Our programme works to empower individuals with the knowledge and resources to make informed health choices. By collaborating with medical professionals, government agencies, and local organizations, Smile Foundation is<strong> </strong>treating illnesses and building healthier communities for the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nutrition plays a pivotal role in shaping the health and future productivity of individuals, and its significance in the first 1000 days of life cannot be overstated. From gestation to a child&#8217;s second birthday, nutrition lays the foundation for lifelong well-being. </p>



<p>Early nutrition significantly influences the health and cognitive potential of an individual. Poor nutrition during this critical period can lead to increased <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1370" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> risks, disabilities and decreased neurocognitive development in children. Additionally, maternal and childhood obesity can negatively impact neurodevelopment. The effects of early nutrition can be long-lasting and may even transcend generations, perpetuating the cycle of nutrition-related health issues.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Progress Over the Decades</strong></h2>



<p>In recent decades, global efforts have made remarkable strides in improving child nutrition, <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2360" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a>, health, and survival. The stark contrast between historical and contemporary child survival rates is a testament to these efforts. In the 1800s, up to 50% of children did not survive to age 5, a figure that had dropped to 4% by 2017. However, the battle is far from won, with 15,000 children under 5 years of age still dying each day, half of these deaths attributed to malnutrition.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Hidden Hunger</strong></h4>



<p>Micronutrient deficiencies, often referred to as &#8220;hidden hunger,&#8221; are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in undernourished infants and young children. While wasting and stunting are more visible forms of malnutrition, hidden hunger poses its own set of challenges and can have significant long-term consequences.</p>



<p>Despite progress, challenges persist, and new threats are emerging, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Stunting rates remain high, overweight and obesity are on the rise, and the associated non-communicable diseases will have far-reaching consequences in the years to come.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Challenge and Opportunity</strong></h2>



<p>Meeting the challenge of providing adequate nutrition, addressing both under and overnutrition, may seem daunting given current environmental and socioeconomic obstacles. However, the first 1000 days also represent a tremendous opportunity. Investing in early nutrition yields lifelong benefits and is perhaps the most valuable investment society can make.</p>



<p>Pregnancy and the first two years of life are often referred to as the &#8220;first 1000 days.&#8221; This unique window of opportunity allows us to intervene and halt persistent malnutrition and the rising epidemic of non-communicable diseases. Efforts are needed to make healthy foods accessible and affordable to families and to empower parents and caregivers to shape their children&#8217;s dietary habits and overall development.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Role of Education in Nutrition</strong></h2>



<p>Education in nutrition, especially for parents, is essential. The early years are a time of remarkable plasticity in humans, allowing us to program metabolic, immunologic, cognitive, behavioural and dietary patterns. To achieve this, educating parents and caregivers is crucial, as they are most eager to learn and apply knowledge to benefit their offspring.</p>



<p>Prioritising nutrition in the first 1000 days not only enhances individual health and well-being but also reduces disparities in health, education, and earning potential, and contributes to the gross domestic product (GDP) of a country. Breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty becomes achievable through early nutrition interventions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Investing in Early Life Nutrition</strong></h2>



<p>Long-term survival has always been a reason to prioritise infant nutrition. However, moral, ethical and scientific imperatives have reinforced the argument for investing in early-life nutrition. Economic returns on such investments are substantial and long-lasting, making it a sound choice for societies worldwide.</p>



<p>The economic argument for investing in the health and education of children is supported by high benefit-cost ratios. Early life nutrition investments are durable, inalienable and portable, benefiting individuals throughout their lives.</p>



<p>On the flip side, the cost of inaction in the realm of nutrition can be staggering. Inadequate nutrition has been linked to significant losses in GDP, primarily due to its impact on cognitive development. Without improvements in nutrition, world GDP would have been significantly lower.</p>



<p>While there is still limited data on the economic cost-benefit of obesity prevention in early childhood, estimates of obesity-related healthcare costs underscore the urgency of intervention. The costs associated with obesity, particularly in healthcare, can be substantial and need to be addressed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Infant Nutrition as a Marker of Progress</strong></h2>



<p>Infant and child nutrition serves as a marker of societal progress. Disparities in nutrition between countries and income groups reflect the state of development and the speed of progress. Focusing on early-life nutrition is not only a moral imperative but also a reflection of society&#8217;s commitment to well-being.</p>



<p>The first 1000 days of nutrition are a critical period that shapes an individual&#8217;s lifelong health and potential. Investing in early-life nutrition is an opportunity to break the cycle of poverty, reduce disparities and enhance the well-being of individuals and societies. It is a sound economic choice with long-lasting benefits and it requires a collective effort from all stakeholders to ensure access to affordable, nutritious food and the dissemination of vital knowledge to parents and caregivers.</p>



<p>By prioritising early nutrition in our women empowerment programme, <strong><em><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/women-empowerment/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Swabhiman</a> </em></strong>for pregnant and lactating women, we are trying to create a healthier, more prosperous world.</p>



<p>Swabhiman is dedicated to empowering marginalised and socially excluded women across India by focusing on three key areas: nutrition, healthcare and <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" title="Livelihood" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="587" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">livelihood</a>. Recognising the critical importance of nutrition during the first 1,000 days—from pregnancy through a child&#8217;s second birthday—the programme offers health education and services to women and adolescent girls through awareness campaigns, health camps and partnerships with local healthcare providers.</p>

<p>In a village in Gujarat’s Bhavnagar, a young 22-year-old mother regularly visits the local healthcare centre for antenatal check-ups. She receives good prenatal support from the medical professionals. During these visits, the experts also monitor her nutritional intake and also prescribe her some supplements as per the need of her body. After a few months, when her son is born, he weighs a healthy 3.2 kilograms and shows no signs of malnutrition or developmental issues. However, thousands or lakhs, of other expecting women in different parts of India do not get the same support as this woman. Many of them are also not aware of the strong link between their <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1351" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> and the health of their child. The link between maternal and child health is critical and it is needed that all the expecting mothers are made aware of the benefits of taking care of themselves during the pregnancy period.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Facts Related to Maternal and Child Health in India</strong></h2>



<p>Even today, there are significant disparities across different socio-economic groups and regions in India when it comes to maternal and child health. Here are some of the important points linked to this:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR)</strong>: India&#8217;s MMR stood at 97 per 100,000 live births as of 2018-19. While it is comparatively better in the country, there is still a big gap between the global standards and India’s performance.</li>



<li><strong>Antenatal Care</strong>: It is essential for monitoring and managing pregnancy-related complications. However, only 50% of pregnant women in India receive the recommended four antenatal care visits.</li>



<li><strong>Institutional Deliveries</strong>: There is a progress in ensuring safe deliveries in India as the country has approximately 79% of births occurring in health facilities. However, there is still a large population that needs access to these facilities.</li>



<li><strong>Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)</strong>: The IMR in India stood at 25 per 1,000 live births in 2022. Again, there is an improvement as compared to the past but there is still a long way to go in efforts for reducing preventable infant deaths.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Link Between Maternal and Child Health</strong></h2>



<p>There are many ways in which maternal health impacts the child’s health. Here are some of the examples-</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Nutrition</strong>: If a woman consumes nutritional food at the time of pregnancy, it directly affects the health of her unborn child. At the same time, if a pregnant women suffers from malnutrition, it can lead to her child being born with developmental issues, low weight, etc. Therefore, a nutritional diet is essential for an expecting mother. It can also be ensured through food supplements.</li>



<li><strong>Prenatal Care</strong>: This nutritional deficiency and other complications can be identified and dealt with at an early stage if a woman has access to regular check-ups during pregnancy. Through regular check-ups, healthcare professionals can provide necessary support to the mothers which then leads to a healthy child being born.</li>



<li><strong>Safe Delivery</strong>: One of the most critical stages of pregnancy is childbirth. There can be many complications that might occur during this stage and access to good quality healthcare is extremely crucial to deal with those complications. Therefore, it is needed that women have access to institutional deliveries. Any problems during delivery can have a severe impact on a child&#8217;s health with life-long repercussions.</li>



<li><strong>Postnatal Care</strong>: First few weeks after the child is born are critical for both the mother and the baby. Therefore, good quality postnatal care is essential to ensure that the child grows up healthy. At the same time, it is essential that the mother is able to feed the child and is healthy enough to provide care.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Initiatives in India</strong></h3>



<p>Several initiatives in India aim to improve maternal and child health. Here are some of the examples:</p>



<p>A number of initiatives by the government involve supporting pregnant women in accessing right support and nutrition. SUMAN (Surakshit Matritva Aashwasan), one such programme by the government, aims to provide quality healthcare to pregnant women and newborns, ensuring safe deliveries and reducing maternal and neonatal mortality. Similarly, Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) encourages institutional deliveries by providing financial incentives to pregnant women, particularly those from low-income families.</p>



<p>At the same time, development organisations also play an important role in supporting expecting mothers. Initiatives by them include spreading awareness about prenatal and postnatal care, building infrastructure on the grassroots, providing medical support, etc. Smile Foundation also works to improve maternal and child health through various programmes. Our <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/the-evolution-of-mobile-medical-units-mmus-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">mobile health clinics</a> provide essential healthcare services to pregnant women and children in remote areas, ensuring access to care for underserved communities. Smile Foundation also collaborates with ASHAs (Accredited Social Health Activists) and Anganwadi workers to promote health <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2339" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> and support for mothers and children.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>The link between maternal and child health is critical and if India wants to reduce its burden of providing medical care to children who are born with deficiencies, it needs to focus on eliminating the root of the problem. By providing necessary support to women during pregnancy, the country can ensure healthy and safe childbirths. Healthy children in turn can grow up to become self-sufficient and contribute to the nation&#8217;s economy and growth in various ways. Therefore, the government, private sector and development organisations need to work together in ensuring maternal health. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>77% of Indian children aged between six and 23 months do not have the minimum diversity in their diet as suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO). States—Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh—have the highest prevalence of Minimum Diet Diversity Failure (MDDF) in the country, according to the report published by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in the National Medical Journal of India. The study was conducted in 707 districts across the country. Of which, 43 districts have more than 90% MDDF, 249 districts have MDDF scores between 80% and 90%, and only 95 districts have a score below 60%.</p>



<p>WHO confirms that about 35% of child deaths and 11% of the total disease burden are related to nutrition-related factors across the world. According to the WHO, about 156 million children aged below five years are estimated to be stunted, 50 million children are estimated to be wasted, and about 42 million children are estimated to be obese across the world in 2015. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Minimum Diet Diversity (MDD)?</strong></h2>



<p>Diversity in diet has always been recognised as one of the significant factors of high-quality diets. For it is an important factor to meet essential nutrients’ requirements. Minimum Dietary Diversity is nothing but an evaluation used to assess the variety and quality of food intake within a specific population. It is often used to measure the adequacy of a person’s diet. It is based on the idea that a more diverse diet, incorporating a wide range of food groups, provides a better chance of meeting nutritional needs and improving overall <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1346" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a>.</p>



<p>By considering MDD as one of its core indicators, the World Health Organization (WHO) has set up a set of guidelines with respect to feeding practices of children aged between 6 and 23 months. According to the WHO, MDD is the consumption of four or more food groups from the seven recommended food groups. The recommended food groups are</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:100%">
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>grains, roots, and tubers</li>



<li>legumes and nuts</li>



<li>dairy products</li>



<li>flesh foods (meat, fish, poultry, and organ meats)</li>



<li>eggs</li>



<li>vitamin-A rich fruits and vegetables</li>



<li>fruits and vegetables</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>



<p>It means that a child is most likely to consume at least one animal-source food and at least one fruit or vegetable in addition to a staple food in a day. By consuming adequately diversified food, one can improve intake of nutrients. It in turn will lead to better nutritional status.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Importance of Minimum Diet Diversity</strong></h2>



<p>MDD plays the role of a simple and effective indicator of dietary quality and nutritional adequacy. Some of the key reasons why MDD is important for understanding and improving nutrition are discussed below.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Micronutrient Coverage</strong>: A diverse diet increases the likelihood of meeting a range of essential requirements of micronutrients like vitamins A, C, iron and zinc and other nutrients like protein and fiber. Undiversified diets often lack important nutrients. This in turn leads to malnutrition or poor health outcomes.</li>



<li><strong>Prevention of Deficiencies</strong>: MDD helps identify populations that are at risk of micronutrient deficiencies. These deficiencies can have long-term health impacts, including stunting, weakened immune systems and cognitive impairments, particularly in children.</li>



<li><strong>Promotes health growth and development</strong>: Children who consume a more diverse diet are more likely to achieve optimal weight gain, cognitive development and overall health. Similarly, when pregnant women consume a diverse range of foods, the risk of complications like anemia, preterm birth and poor fetal growth can be reduced. MDD is a key determinant of healthy growth and development.</li>



<li><strong>Malnutrition</strong>: Low dietary diversity is strongly associated with both undernutrition like stunting and overnutrition like obesity and diabetes. MDD serves as a useful tool in identifying populations at risk on both ends of the spectrum. This in turn helps to prevent and cure malnourishment in children.</li>



<li><strong>Effective and low-cost indicator</strong>: MDD is easy to measure and does not require expensive or complicated tools or laboratories. It simply requires a food recall and a classification of food groups consumed, making it a practical tool for large-scale surveys, especially in low-resource settings. It is often used for global health assessments and intervention programmes.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How does Minimum Diet Diversity Failure (MDDF) affect children?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Time and again, studies reinstate the need to meet MDD standards set by the WHO because of its negative health outcomes on children. But nutritionally adequate and diversified foods are consumed only by a few children across the world. One of the main reasons for undernourishment in children in developing countries is MDDF. Their diets are mostly based on staple foods and seasonal fruits and vegetables with no or few animal products. Research links more than two-thirds of malnutrition-related deaths in children with inappropriate and poor feeding practices during the initial 24 months of their life.</p>



<p>A study published by the National Library of Medicine says that only one-fourth of infants aged between six and 23 months meet the dietary diversity standards. Children who do not meet this standard after 6 months of age are prone to becoming nutritional deficiencies can also lead to smaller adult stature, impaired cognitive development and growth stunted. Also, nutritional deficiencies can also lead to smaller adult stature, impaired cognitive development and growth retardation. This in turn might impact their academics leading to low economic productivity.</p>



<p>One of the most common consequences of inadequate dietary diversity is iron deficiency. This in turn leads to anemia. Anemia in children impairs oxygen transport in the blood, leading to fatigue, weakness and developmental delays. Severe iron deficiency can even affect cognitive function and school performance. </p>



<p>Similarly, poor dietary diversity leads to vitamin A, D, zinc, and calcium deficiencies. While vitamin A deficiency can lead to night blindness and increase susceptibility to infections, children with low zinc intake may have a higher risk of infections, stunted growth and impaired cognitive development. Calcium and vitamin D deficiencies can lead to impaired bone development, rickets and other skeletal issues.</p>



<p>Lack of essential nutrients like iron, zinc, iodine and omega-3 fatty acids can impair cognitive function, leading to learning difficulties and delayed speech. Nutritional deficiencies during critical periods of growth can have permanent effects on brain structure and function, resulting in lower IQ and reduced school performance. </p>



<p>Deficiencies in nutrients like vitamin B12, folate and iron have been linked to irritability, poor concentration, and depression in children. Lack of nutrients like vitamin A, D and C, and zinc can weaken the immune system of children. Poor immune function leads to frequent illness, which further reduces a child&#8217;s ability to absorb nutrients, creating a vicious cycle of poor health and malnutrition. Infections deplete essential nutrients and hinder recovery, worsening nutritional deficiencies.</p>



<p>Stunting is the result of chronic malnutrition during the first 1000 days of a child. Stunted children may have permanent developmental delays. This condition is often associated with long-term cognitive impairments, poor school performance and lower economic productivity in adulthood. At the same time, acute malnutrition can lead to wasting (being underweight for height). Wasted children are at a much higher risk of death from infections and other diseases. Malnourished children are at higher risk of developing chronic diseases like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and obesity in adulthood.</p>



<p>Experts suggest that children need more energy and nutrient-dense foods to grow and develop during their first two years of life. They term the stint an opportunity to prevent malnutrition. They need high nutrients in addition to breast milk even to sustain normal development during this period. Because they are prone to frequent diseases like infection and diarrhea. Hence, it is highly recommended to provide safe, adequate, appropriate and frequent feeding to children to attain optimal growth.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smile&#8217;s Nutrition intervention</strong></h3>



<p>Smile Foundation’s nutrition initiatives, strengthened by strategic partnerships, are creating impactful change in combating malnutrition and promoting dietary diversity among underserved communities in India. One standout project is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5cQmhDovYM" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Nutrition Enhancement Program (NEP)</a>, launched in collaboration with the PepsiCo Foundation and the Sangrur District Administration, which has surpassed its targets, directly impacting over 16,000 beneficiaries and reaching approximately 45,000 individuals in Punjab’s Sangrur district. This three-year initiative focused on improving the nutrition of pregnant women, lactating mothers, and young children across 23 villages and 27 Anganwadi Centers, significantly reducing anemia rates and improving maternal and child health.</p>



<p>The NEP’s comprehensive approach included training Anganwadi workers, conducting over 260 health camps, establishing community kitchen gardens and building capacity in local schools. The programme also developed recipe booklets and ran anemia awareness sessions, addressing stunting, malnutrition and inadequate diet diversity—issues that impact women and children disproportionately. In alignment with India’s Poshan Abhiyaan, the programme exemplifies how multi-sector partnerships can yield transformative results for community health, ultimately contributing to India’s broader goals for nutritional security. Through these initiatives, Smile Foundation continues to advocate for sustainable health solutions, focusing on vulnerable populations and fostering community resilience through <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2332" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a>, empowerment and holistic care.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Moving from bane to boon</strong></h3>



<p>MDDF in children can have wide-ranging effects on their physical, emotional and cognitive development. It increases the risk of micronutrient deficiencies, growth stunting, delayed motor and cognitive development and poor health outcomes. In the long term, it can also set the stage for chronic diseases and poor educational outcomes, undermining a child&#8217;s ability to reach their full potential. Ensuring that children have access to a diverse, nutrient-rich diet is a fundamental aspect of promoting their healthy development and preventing both immediate and long-term health issues.</p>

<p>Nutrition is fundamental for good health and well-being. It promotes growth and development, ensuring proper physical and cognitive development. Nutrition provides the energy needed for daily activities and bodily functions. It is also linked to better mental and physiological <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1316" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a>. In today’s era of artificial intelligence, everything seems to be artificial including our food and dietary habits. Just like information is so readily available; anywhere &amp; everywhere, just in one click, we want our food in the same manner, just in one single click.</p>



<p>Reports suggest that most working professionals living in a tier-1 city order at least one meal from outside. With food delivery apps lodging a growth rate of 15.98% in India and projecting a rise to a 9.7-billion-dollar market by 2025, it seems a good startup venture but is alarming for health and wellness. On the contrary, it could be a good time to enter the health and wellness industry since the rise of food delivery apps will also lead to a rise in several lifestyle disorders and heart-related diseases. Due to changing food and lifestyle choices, people are forgetting their roots, traditional foods and eating methods. They are carelessly filling their plates and stomachs, ignoring the nutrition criteria. Let’s get a brief understanding of what nutrients are:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a><strong>Nutrients</strong></h2>



<p>In layman&#8217;s language, nutrients are the&nbsp;compounds in food that provide us with energy&nbsp;that facilitates repair and growth and helps us carry out different life processes. Nutrients can be broadly categorized into macronutrients and micronutrients. These can be further classified as:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a>Macronutrients</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Carbohydrates: They are the body’s main sources of energy. They can be found in foods like bread, rice, pasta, fruits, and vegetables.</li>



<li>Proteins: They are essential for the growth, repair, and maintenance of body tissues. Sources include pulses, beans, nuts, dairy products, etc.</li>



<li>Fat: They are energy storehouses that protect organs and aid in the absorption of vitamins.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a>Micronutrients (Also known as vitals)</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Vitamins: These are organic compounds that are crucial for various bodily functions. For example, Vitamin C is important for the immune system, while Vitamin D is essential for bone health.</li>



<li>Minerals: Inorganic elements like calcium, potassium and iron are vital for processes such as bone formation, nerve function and oxygen transport in the blood.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a><strong>Nutrition Crisis</strong></h2>



<p>In a study, it was found that about 99.3 percent of the global population intake insufficient nutrients. The findings also suggested that around the world, almost 70 percent, or over five billion, people do not consume enough iodine, vitamin E and calcium. In India, while more women consumed insufficient amounts of iodine, vitamin B12 and iron, compared to men, more men consumed inadequate amounts of zinc and magnesium, vitamin B6, zinc and vitamin C, compared to women. This leads to a nutrition crisis where a significant portion of the population is unable to access or consume adequate nutrients necessary for maintaining health. This can result from various factors, including food insecurity or scarcity, economic instability, natural disasters, climate change, health crises such as pandemics, or conflicts and displacements due to wars causing food production and distribution disruptions.</p>



<p>A nutrition crisis that lasts for a long time can lead to various disruptions and issues. This includes malnutrition leading to wasting, stunting, or an underweight population. Severe malnutrition, especially in children, can lead to higher mortality rates. Chronic malnutrition can also affect physical and cognitive development, particularly in children. Malnutrition can reduce productivity and increase healthcare costs, perpetuating a cycle of poverty and underdevelopment. We need to implement sustainable agricultural practices, improve food systems and enhance economic resilience. This will also help us ensure access to healthcare and nutrition <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2302" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> to prevent and treat malnutrition.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a><strong>Nutrition crisis is a complex issue</strong></h2>



<p>Addressing these issues requires a comprehensive approach that includes improving economic conditions, enhancing agricultural practices, strengthening healthcare and sanitation, ensuring effective implementation of government programmes and addressing social inequalities. Let’s discuss some major reasons for the nutrition crisis:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In India, a significant portion of the <strong>population lives below the poverty line</strong>, limiting their access to nutritious food. This also leads to economic disparities where while some regions and communities have better access to food, others struggle with severe shortages.</li>



<li>Agricultural practices like cropping patterns of a country also hold significant importance when it comes to food availability. In India, the major focus remains on cultivating rice and wheat which often<strong> overshadows the production of more nutritious crops</strong> like millet and pulses. This also happens due to ineffective policy interventions and low minimum selling price policies.</li>



<li><strong>Limited access to healthcare services</strong>, especially in rural areas is the major reason for exacerbating malnutrition in India. These poor sanitation and hygiene practices lead to diseases that can worsen nutritional status.</li>



<li>Insufficient <strong>public health expenditure is still only about 1.3% of India’s GDP</strong>, which is insufficient to address the widespread malnutrition. Adding to it, programs like the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) and mid-day meal schemes have also faced disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>



<li>Social factors like <strong>gender inequality and low literacy rates </strong>are also responsible. Women, especially in rural areas, often have less access to nutritious food leading to higher rates of malnutrition among women and children. Similarly, a lack of knowledge and awareness affects their ability to make informed nutritional choices.</li>



<li>Sometimes <strong>natural disasters, pandemics or extreme weather events</strong> leading to floods, drought and other climate-related events can destroy crops and reduce food availability.</li>
</ul>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Let food be your medicine</strong></h1>



<p>Ensuring access to nutritious food for all remains a challenge. This needs the combined efforts of the government, local self-help groups, nonprofits and other social organisations to ensure food security and awareness for all. Strengthening agricultural policies that promote sustainable farming, improving public distribution system (PDS) efficiency and expanding programmes like the National Food Security Act (NFSA) to ensure that nutritious food reaches marginalised populations. Nonprofits can also work with local organisations to spread nutrition education and awareness.</p>



<p>Smile Foundation also works in rural areas to spread nutritional awareness. We conduct school and community programmes to emphasise <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/nutrition-support-for-better-learning-outcomes/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">nutrition education</a> from a young age, fostering lifelong healthy eating habits. Food available today lacks nutrition due to various uncertain reasons and the changing climate. In such cases, scaling up fortification efforts for common foods like rice, wheat and edible oils with essential vitamins and minerals, such as iron, folic acid and vitamin A is crucial. This can also be added to food programmes like the Midday Meal Scheme. Government programmes like the Anaemia Mukt Bharat and Poshan Abhiyan should be reinforced with better monitoring and coverage, ensuring that iron, folic acid and other nutrient supplements reach those in need.</p>



<p>Smile Foundation’s Smile on Wheels initiative visits the remotest areas of the country with our mobile hospital and a great medical team that regularly checks treats and updates health-related issues of the residents providing them with the best facility at their doorsteps. The programme also covers maternal and child nutrition for long-term health improvements. The government’s efforts to strengthen primary healthcare systems and integrate nutrition counseling into routine healthcare services can encourage better dietary practices.</p>



<p>As Hippocrates said, “Let food be your medicine and medicine be your food.” So, before you need to rely on medicines, make food your medicine to heal your body. Awareness about nutrition will go a long way and encourage mindful and conscious eating habits.</p>

<p>Nutrition is a way of living. Good nutrition is essential for maintaining overall health, supporting growth and development, and enhancing the quality of life. It helps prevent malnutrition in all its forms, including undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies and obesity. A balanced diet can help prevent non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and certain cancers. Nutrition plays a significant role in brain development and cognitive function, particularly for children and adolescents. </p>



<p>Good nutrition contributes to a longer and healthier life by reducing the risk of age-related diseases and conditions. Healthy individuals are more productive and can contribute more effectively to their communities and economies. These vital nutrients come from the food you eat. Ann Wigmore said, “The food you eat can be either the safest and most powerful form of medicine or the slowest form of poison.&#8221;</p>



<p>National Nutrition Week in India was first observed in 1982 by the Ministry of Women and Child Development. It is celebrated from September 1<sup>st</sup> to 7<sup>th</sup> as a campaign organised by the Government of India to raise awareness about the importance of nutrition and healthy eating habits. This week aims to address nutritional deficiencies and promote a healthier nation. It emphasises the critical role nutrition plays in overall well-being. </p>



<p>Additionally, it highlights the prevention of lifestyle-related diseases through good nutrition. The campaign has grown, with various activities, workshops and programmes organised nationwide to educate people about nutrition-based interventions to combat malnutrition. This year, the theme was “Nutritious Diets for Everyone”, aligning with the United Nations’ goal for sustainable development.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>National Nutrition Week raises awareness</strong></h2>



<p>It highlights the current nutritional challenges in India, such as malnutrition, undernutrition and lifestyle-related diseases. Its primary goals are to educate, raise awareness and promote nutritional interventions. Let’s discuss a few major goals:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Increasing public awareness</strong> about the importance of nutrition for <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1310" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> and well-being is the key motto of the campaign. This includes educating people on the benefits of a balanced diet and the risks associated with poor nutrition.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Encouraging individuals to <strong>adopt healthier eating habits</strong> by providing information on nutritious foods, meal planning, and the importance of a varied diet. This also includes educating how nutrition doesn’t need to be expensive and that local food could provide a balanced meal.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Addressing issues of malnutrition, undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies</strong>, particularly among vulnerable groups such as children, pregnant women and the elderly helps to reach the goal faster as only when the women of the house are healthy, the nation is healthier.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Implementing and promoting nutritional interventions and programmes</strong>, such as the Mid-Day Meal Scheme and food fortification, Public Health Campaigns, Rural Women’s Self-Help Groups, etc. to improve the nutritional status of the population are crucial.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Providing <strong><a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2289" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> on food safety practices</strong> to prevent foodborne illnesses to ensure the consumption of safe and hygienic food.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Highlighting the importance of physical activity</strong> in conjunction with a nutritious diet for overall health and well-being and advocating for policies and programmes that support nutritional health, including those that address food security, agricultural practices and public health initiatives.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Major interventions of the National Nutrition Week</strong></h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>At the Global Bio India Roadshow scheduled from September 2-14, 2024, CSIR-Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), Mysore called to minimise nutrient loss during food processing through the right processing methods, temperature control, considering fortification and using fresh ingredients. This also highlights the funding opportunities for food and beverage start-ups in the country.</li>



<li>Chirag Kumar Paswan, minister of Food Processing Industries emphasised the importance of a nutritious diet for everyone, aligning with the theme, “Feeding Right from Start”. He also spoke about the broader goals of promoting food security, reducing agricultural wastage and ensuring value addition in the food processing sector.</li>



<li>Special programmes have been launched by the Indian Government to provide nutritional support to vulnerable populations, including pregnant women, lactating mothers and children under five.</li>



<li>In line with the theme, Feeding Smart Right from Start, various public campaigns have been launched to educate the public about the importance of balanced diets and healthy eating habits. These campaigns focus on different age groups, from infants to the elderly.</li>



<li>New guidelines have also been introduced to improve the nutritional quality of meals provided in schools with more fruits, vegetables and whole grains in school lunches.</li>



<li>Government and NGOs also conducted workshops and seminars at the community level to educate parents, educators and community leaders about the importance of nutrition and how to make healthier food choices.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Nonprofits in the mighty era of social media</strong></h2>



<p>Nonprofits also took an <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/national-nutrition-month-this-ngo-is-aiming-to-eradicate-anaemia-among-adolescent-girls-in-a-gurgaon-community-2/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">active part in the National Nutrition Week</a>. Organisations like Smile Foundation aim to address nutritional deficiencies and promote a healthier nation by encouraging balanced diets and healthy eating habits. NGOs organised nutrition fairs where farmers, vendors and community members learned about and accessed nutrient-rich foods to promote sustainable agricultural practices.  In the social media era, engaging posts, videos and live sessions with nutrition experts were also shared across various platforms to spread awareness about good nutrition practices to a wider audience.</p>



<p>Smile also organised Community Nutrition Camps during the week to provide free health check-ups and nutritional counselling. We also conducted special school programmes to teach children about the benefits of good nutrition. These programmes included interactive sessions, games and activities to make learning about nutrition fun and engaging. To make the nutrition programme more effective and far-reaching, Smile also collaborated with other local NGOs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A healthy individual builds a healthy nation</strong></h3>



<p>Individuals can also take active participation and contribute to a healthier community by promoting the importance of good nutrition. Individuals can work with local leaders to promote and implement nutrition programmes in the community. To participate in community outreach programmes, they can also support and volunteer with local nonprofits that are working on nutrition-related projects. They can advocate for better nutrition policies in schools and workplaces. They can also take part in local nutrition fairs where people can learn about and access healthy foods. Ensuring good nutrition with regular physical activity for overall well-being through regular physical activity along with healthy meal planning to work on personal health and nutrition goals can also contribute to the nation’s overall good nutrition and well-being.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Nutrition Week 2024 was a success</strong></h3>



<p>National Nutrition Week 2024 brought about significant change through several innovative approaches and impactful initiatives. By leveraging technology, social media buzz was also created to enhance digital outreach that helped conduct virtual workshops and webinars and launch interactive mobile apps to provide personalised nutrition advice and education. Consumption of local produce and Sustainable Agriculture was also encouraged for long-term food security and better nutrition. Various private companies, local nonprofits, the government, community leaders and influencers also participated to promote nutrition awareness to foster a sense of ownership and commitment. This also helped amplify the reach and impact of nutrition programmes.&nbsp;</p>
