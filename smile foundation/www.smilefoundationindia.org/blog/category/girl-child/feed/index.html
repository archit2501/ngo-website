										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a quiet classroom in Odisha, a girl named Shalini stood up to answer a question. She had no idea her life was about to change. A red stain on her seat, a marker of her first period, brought giggles, whispers, and then silence. No one had told her what menstruation was. She thought she was ill. The next day, overwhelmed by shame, she begged her parents not to send her back to school. And just like that, the promise of a brighter future began to fade.</p>



<p>Shalini’s story is not unique. Across rural India, girls face a combination of stigma, silence, and inaccessibility when it comes to managing their periods. Without awareness, proper facilities, or access to sanitary products, many are pushed out of classrooms, losing days of learning and, eventually, the opportunity for a better future.</p>

<p><strong>UNICEF &amp; WATERAID INDIA STUDY (2015)*</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-unspoken-numbers"><strong>The unspoken numbers</strong></h2>



<p>According to UNICEF India, over 253 million adolescents live in India, with nearly half being girls and 25% of them in rural areas. Despite several government-led menstrual hygiene initiatives, thousands of girls still drop out of school due to shame, pain, poor access to products, and lack of supportive infrastructure.</p>



<p>A qualitative study in six Delhi government schools found that around <a href="https://jointactionforwater.org/a-study-of-school-absenteeism-during-menstruation-amongst-adolescent-girls-in-india/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">40% of girls missed school</a> during menstruation owing to menstrual pain, fear of staining, and restrictive social norms.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-period-absenteeism-why">Period absenteeism-why?</h3>



<p>Whether in rural villages or urban neighbourhoods, a girl’s first period often arrives unannounced and with fear. Her body undergoes unfamiliar changes, but in the absence of support and information, this moment becomes isolating. When compounded by poor infrastructure, stigma, and silence, menstruation becomes not just a personal struggle, but an educational barrier.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Social taboos&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Even today, in many parts of India, menstruating girls and women are subjected to regressive restrictions like being barred from entering temples, kitchens, or even touching food on the grounds of being “impure.” These practices are reinforced by harmful myths, such as the belief that menstrual blood is toxic or that using sanitary pads causes infertility. As a result, many girls are pushed toward using cloth or other unhygienic alternatives compromising their <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2606" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a>, dignity, and confidence.</p>



<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Poor menstrual product access</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>In many rural communities, girls face limited access to safe menstrual products, clean cloth. or private drying spaces. Adding to their troubles is the issue of no proper disposal facilities; they often resort to using ashes or rags as quiet acts of desperation that compromise their health and dignity.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Menstrual hygiene in Indian women (15-24yrs)</strong></p>



<p>Recent data reflects encouraging progress: 78% of women in India now use hygienic menstrual methods such as sanitary napkins, tampons, or menstrual cups indicating growing awareness and improved access. However, among adolescent girls, only 42% rely exclusively on these hygienic practices*, with significant disparities persisting across states and districts. This gap underscores the urgent need for targeted interventions that address both availability and cultural barriers in underserved regions.</p>



<p><em>Menstrual hygiene practices among adolescent women in rural India: a cross-sectional study</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeNTUwnB5U0K46Gp1CXcPGNGWqh7fA6kJfVctJhTGmgf2jU9o4pe6E1nW2TOA99V09n9Rdu4bZqwUY8U03gS6RVjIZrXf287cQjcJEPE8I4kk7as5qko7XVA3kFAEPazop1WFKaZQ?key=-SWeFV2KTfjqIdMTjWd1DA" alt=""/></figure>

<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Paying the hidden cost of secrecy and infrastructure gaps</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Many girls across rural India navigate their periods in secrecy by hiding pads in books, fearing stains, missing school events, and sometimes their yearly reviews as well because of menstruation. With no dustbins, running water, or private toilets in schools, managing menstrual hygiene becomes near impossible. The result is a deafening mix of isolation, shame, and lost days of learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Menstrual health is a national priority</strong></p>



<p>India has taken steps in the right direction. The Menstrual Hygiene Scheme (MHS), by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, offers subsidised sanitary napkins and peer counselling through ASHA workers. The Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK) promotes adolescent health, including menstrual awareness. The Suvidha Scheme by the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilisers introduced biodegradable sanitary pads at ₹1, increasing affordability.</p>



<p>Yet gaps persist. Many of these programmes struggle to reach India’s most marginalised girls. Product availability doesn’t always translate to product use, especially when surrounded by silence and stigma.</p>



<p>As a result, many adolescent girls navigate menstruation in isolation—confused, unprepared, and unsupported. For countless girls, this social conditioning leads to school absenteeism, diminishing their confidence, academic continuity, and long-term opportunities.</p>



<p><strong>Addressing the gaps through strategic partnerships&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>To bridge these challenges, strategic CSR–NGO partnerships are serving as catalytic agents. By combining grassroots reach with corporate scale, these collaborations have the potential to advance menstrual hygiene management as a systemic solution driving health equity, school retention, and long-term social impact for adolescent girls across India.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-improving-school-infrastructure-beyond-brick-and-mortar"><strong>Improving school infrastructure beyond brick and mortar</strong></h3>



<p>One major challenge for school girls from rural communities during menstruation is the lack of functional school infrastructure; poor washrooms, inadequate disposal, limited water, and no privacy often lead to school dropouts.</p>



<p><strong>What can be done</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Support the development of gender sensitive washrooms with lockable doors, running water, disposable bins and incinerators.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>By partnering with NGOs, corporates can implement their CSR goals for women empowerment. Through impact dashboards, the projects can be tracked to identify the usage, maintenance, and overall the hygienic parameters required for young girls in home and schools.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-culture-stigma-needs-community-solutions-nbsp"><strong>Culture stigma needs community solutions&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>One of the most important issues that must be addressed immediately at a large scale is the lack of awareness about <strong>menstrual health </strong>amongst young girls and their communities. This becomes more concerning when the concerns of young girls are silenced due to vulture silence, shame, and myths that often lead to fear, poor hygiene, and isolation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What can be done</strong></p>



<p>Corporates can support community based menstrual literacy programmes where they can collaborate with local organisations, ASHA workers and peer educators to increase awareness on menstrual hygiene. Furthermore, they can also educate the girls, teachers and community workers through culturally adapted IEC tools (flipbooks, comics, digital stories ) to challenge taboos and normalise conversations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take the example of <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/smilescapes-august-2024/in-focus-3/#:~:text=A%20case%20in%20point%20here,developed%20a%20health%2Dseeking%20behavior." data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Shivani</a>. Once hesitant and withdrawn, she found her footing through menstrual health sessions conducted by Smile Foundation’s <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/women-empowerment/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Swabhiman</a> programme. With accurate information and support, she gained not only knowledge, but also the confidence to speak up. Today, she serves as a peer educator empowering other adolescent girls in her community and promoting health-seeking behaviour.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of its integrated approach to women’s health, Smile Foundation’s Swabhiman trains <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/workshops-events/27-swabhiman-volunteers-trained-on-reproductive-and-menstrual-health-2/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">community-based volunteers</a> as reproductive and menstrual health educators in underserved areas. This capacity-building intervention strategically addresses knowledge gaps, dismantles cultural taboos, and promotes safe menstrual hygiene practices directly reducing school absenteeism and health risks among adolescent girls. By embedding peer-led advocacy into last-mile delivery, the initiative strengthens behavioural change at the community level while aligning with national adolescent health goals and SDG targets.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-making-innovation-accessible-affordable-and-adaptable-nbsp"><strong>Making innovation accessible, affordable, and adaptable&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>As key drivers of social impact, CSR–NGO partnerships are well positioned to eliminate unhygienic menstrual practices such as the use of cloth, ash, or sacks by co-developing and scaling access to affordable sanitary products tailored for rural adolescent girls. In light of growing environmental concerns, these partnerships must also prioritise innovation in biodegradable and reusable menstrual solutions, ensuring both adolescent health and ecological sustainability. Such an approach aligns with ESG goals and supports long-term, community-based health equity.</p>



<p><strong>What can be done</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Support women-led production units for biodegradable sanitary napkins or menstrual cups.</li>



<li>Collaborate on last mile distribution through workshops in local communities and schools, <em>Anganwadis </em>and frontline health workers.</li>
</ul>



<p>For instance, through targeted <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/workshops-events/workshop-on-menstrual-hygiene-to-spread-awareness-on-safe-menstrual-practices-2/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">workshops on menstrual hygiene</a>, Smile Foundation’s Swabhiman programme ensures last-mile delivery of accurate, stigma-free education to adolescent girls in underserved communities. By promoting body literacy and safe hygiene practices, the initiative empowers girls with the confidence to stay in school, safeguard their health, and become agents of change in their communities.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Support impact evaluations to track product adoption, usage frequency, and behavioural shifts.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>When girls stay in school, whole societies flourish. UNESCO notes that nations’ commitments to girls’ education have “generated huge dividends” in recent decades. Better‐educated girls become healthier mothers and more productive workers. In fact, analyses suggest that barriers to girls’ schooling cost countries trillions – one World Bank study estimates $15–30 trillion in lost lifetime productivity due to curtailed schooling for women. By contrast, the payoff from investing in girls&#8217; <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2459" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> is enormous. </p>



<p>A recent report found that every $1 invested in girls’ education returns about $2.80 in extra GDP, enough to raise developing-country GDP by roughly 10% over the next decade if all girls finished secondary school. Rwanda’s experience illustrates the potential: by enshrining gender equity after the 1994 genocide, Rwanda today has women filling 52% of its secondary school seats and 54% of the workforce – and its per capita income more than doubled between 2000 and 2015. In short, educators and economists alike agree that <strong>investing in girls is one of the highest-return strategies in development</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Social and health benefits</strong> <strong>of investing in girls</strong></h2>



<p>The ripple effects of a girl in school extend to families and communities. Better-educated women tend to </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>marry later, </li>



<li>have fewer children, and </li>



<li>adopt healthier practices. </li>
</ul>



<p>UNICEF emphasises that educated girls are &#8220;<em>far less likely to marry young and more likely to lead healthy, productive lives</em>.&#8221; For example, children of literate mothers survive at much higher rates: a child born to a mother who can read is about <strong>50% more likely</strong> to reach age five than a child whose mother is illiterate. </p>



<p>Education also boosts preventive care: in Indonesia, just 19% of children whose mothers had no schooling were fully immunised, versus 68% of children whose mothers had secondary education. Small gains add up – one estimate is that one extra year of schooling for every 1,000 women prevents two maternal deaths. Educated mothers understand nutrition, immunisation and hygiene, so their children are less likely to be malnourished or get common diseases. In short, every year a girl spends learning tends to translate into a year of better <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1454" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> and opportunity for her whole family.</p>



<p>The impacts go beyond health. When girls learn, they also earn more and help economies grow. Educated women are more likely to enter the formal labour force and secure higher-paying jobs. UNICEF notes that as girls’ education rises, “girls…earn higher incomes” and are better able to support their families. At the macro level, countries with greater gender equality in education enjoy higher incomes. </p>



<p>In fact, an IMF analysis found that <strong>in every region of the world, the country with the least gender inequality has a higher per-capita income than the country with the greatest inequality</strong>. In practical terms, this means closing the gender gap in schooling is correlated with more tax revenues, stronger domestic markets and faster poverty reduction. The Brookings Institution puts it plainly: girls’ education “improves women’s wages and families’ nutrition, reduces the incidence of child marriage…empowers women and contributes to economic growth”. These are not separate issues – they all stem from giving girls the same chances to learn.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Success stories in the Global South</strong></h2>



<p>Many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) offer powerful examples. Bangladesh is often cited as a girls’ education success story. In 1970, girls made up only about 17% of secondary students; by 2000, they were more than half of the class. Concerted policies – from recruiting more female teachers to creating stipend programmes – helped achieve near-parity in primary and secondary enrolment. Those gains translated into societal changes: rising female education in Bangladesh <strong>contributed to sharp declines in child marriage and fertility</strong>, and laid the groundwork for faster economic growth. </p>



<p>Likewise, Rwanda’s post-conflict government explicitly invested in girls and women. Today Rwanda leads the world in female parliamentarians and almost closed its gender school gap; its economy has been one of sub-Saharan Africa’s fastest-growing. These countries illustrate how investing in girls’ schooling fuels a virtuous cycle of development.</p>



<p>Yet pockets of exclusion remain and remind us of the work ahead. UNESCO warns of “stubborn pockets of exclusion”: in some African nations (and in Afghanistan), well over half of school-aged girls still have no schooling. In rural, poor communities, entrenched norms and lack of facilities keep girls at home. Even in countries with overall gender parity, boys often dominate higher levels and STEM fields.</p>



<p>UNESCO notes that in 87% of education systems, eighth-grade boys are more likely than girls to consider science or mathematics careers. These gaps mean millions of girls’ potential remain untapped. Closing them would unleash more of the development dividend – more skilled workers, more innovators, and healthier families.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Investing in girls: Smile Foundation’s work</strong></h2>



<p>What does this evidence mean for India? India has made progress (gender parity in primary schooling is within reach), but stark inequalities persist. As Smile Foundation’s leaders note, “the burden of poverty weighs down heavier on girls”. While girls from well-off families average nine years of schooling, girls from the poorest 20% often get <strong>no schooling at all</strong>. Civil society has stepped in to bridge these gaps. Smile Foundation, for example, serves 1.5 million children annually through over 450 projects in 27 states. Many of our flagship programmes specifically target girls in education, recognising that investing in girls yields wide benefits for Indian communities.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>She Can Fly: Keeping girls in schools</strong></h3>



<p>Smile’s <strong><a href="https://donate.smilefoundationindia.org/donate-for-girl-child" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">She Can Fly</a></strong> campaign exemplifies this approach. Described as “a flagship initiative…to enable, equip and empower girl children with quality education, proper nutrition, good health, adequate skills, and above all…self-confidence”, She Can Fly tackles the reasons girls drop out. It provides scholarships and stipends to cover school fees and supplies, offers mentoring and laptop grants, and organizes life-skills workshops to build confidence. </p>



<p>By meeting girls’ needs holistically, the programme helps talented students from remote or poor families “live their lives to their fullest potential”. To date, hundreds of girls have benefited each year – an investment that promises returns in the form of future teachers, engineers, and entrepreneurs who might otherwise have been lost to child marriage or labour.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Scholarships and STEM for the next generation</strong></h3>



<p>For girls who make it through school, Smile ensures the support continues. Our <strong>Scholarship Programme</strong> provides financial aid to girls from disadvantaged communities so they can pursue higher education. These scholarships <em>“ensure uninterrupted education”</em> and are paired with life-skills training in critical thinking, communication and leadership. Recipients like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/smilefoundationindia/reel/DADIGDBiE96/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Sanjana</a> (an engineering aspirant) often remark that without this backing they could not afford college. In this way, Smile helps turn school leavers into college graduates and future role models in their villages.</p>



<p>Beyond funding, Smile also invests in making education relevant and exciting. Recognising the global skills gap, Smile has launched STEM projects for rural girls. In one such partnership with CooperSurgical, we opened a new science lab at a government girls’ school (KGBV) in Uttar Pradesh, serving some 400 students. In this lab, girls do hands-on experiments, build models and participate in science fairs. The initiative is “improving their understanding of science and math” and developing “problem-solving and critical thinking skills”. These experiences spark curiosity and show girls they can excel in fields traditionally seen as out-of-reach.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Breaking taboos: Menstrual health through Swabhiman</strong></h3>



<p>No discussion of girls’ education is complete without menstrual hygiene. Periods are a leading reason adolescent girls skip or drop out of school. Smile’s <strong><a href="https://donate.smilefoundationindia.org/women-empowerment/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Swabhiman</a></strong> women’s empowerment programme directly tackles this taboo. Operating since 2012, Swabhiman trains local women as peer educators and “change agents” on menstrual health. They run community meetings and distribute sanitary napkins, so girls can attend school without fear or shame. This effort addresses a harsh reality: a UN survey found that <strong>about one-third of schoolgirls drop out</strong> when they hit puberty due to lack of sanitation and stigma. By demystifying menstruation and providing supplies, Swabhiman keeps girls in class – and shows families that educating daughters matters at every stage of life.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Unleashing the development dividend</strong></h2>



<p>The evidence is overwhelming: educating girls is not just a moral imperative, it is smart economics. In practical terms, every girl in school means a healthier workforce, higher productivity and stronger communities. In India and around the world, the returns on this investment are literally in the billions. Supporting programmes like She Can Fly, STEM labs, scholarships and health campaigns gives us a development multiplier. When a girl flies, she lifts an entire economy – and that is the true development dividend.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>“You educate a man, you educate a family; you educate a woman, you educate a community.” These timeless words, attributed to Mahatma Gandhi, reflect a truth India is still reckoning with: when girls are educated, everyone benefits. And yet, millions of Indian girls are still denied access to even basic education despite decades of policy reforms and social initiatives.</p>



<p>In 2023, over 4 million adolescent girls in India were reported out of school, according to the Ministry of Education. While universal enrolment in primary schools has improved over the years, retention drops significantly as girls grow older. The <em>Unified District Information System for <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2449" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Education</a> Plus</em> (UDISE+) data from 2021-22 shows that the Gross Enrolment Ratio for girls drops from 99.67% at the primary level to 76.6% at the higher secondary level. And these figures hide deeper disparities based on caste, income, location, and religion.</p>



<p>In rural areas, girls’ education is often the first sacrifice when families face economic pressure. Whether due to poverty, early marriage, domestic responsibilities, or a lack of accessible and safe schools, too many girls are still being kept at home. The 2011 Census reported a national female literacy rate of 65.46%, while male literacy was 82.14%. In states like Bihar and Rajasthan, the gender literacy gap remains above 20 percentage points. Even in urban areas, systemic biases persist, especially among marginalised communities.</p>



<p>And yet, the benefits of educating girls in India are irrefutable. According to the National Family <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1444" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Health</a> Survey (NFHS-5), women with 10 or more years of schooling are far more likely to delay marriage and childbirth, access healthcare, and ensure their children are vaccinated. A 2019 World Bank study concluded that every additional year of schooling for girls in India could increase their future income by up to 20%.</p>



<p>More education also translates into better health outcomes. India still contributes to a significant portion of the world’s maternal deaths, and studies show that women with secondary education are three times more likely to receive prenatal care and give birth in a health facility compared to those with no education. Furthermore, children of educated mothers are more likely to survive infancy and complete their own schooling.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>So why does this gap persist?</strong></h2>



<p>The problem isn’t only about access—it’s about <strong>sensitisation</strong>. Sensitisation goes beyond awareness. It’s about changing the cultural and structural norms that continue to undervalue girls. In many families, especially in economically disadvantaged regions, girls are still seen as temporary members expected to marry, move away, and support someone else’s household. Education, therefore, is often seen as a luxury rather than a right or an investment.</p>



<p>India has launched several ambitious initiatives to address this. Schemes like <strong>Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao</strong>, the <strong>Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBV)</strong> residential schools for girls from marginalised groups, and the <strong>National Scheme of Incentives to Girls for Secondary Education</strong> are steps in the right direction. Midday meal programmes and free textbooks have helped increase attendance at the primary level. However, implementation gaps, insufficient infrastructure (especially for adolescent girls), and social resistance often dilute their impact.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the lack of gender-sensitive infrastructure such as functional girls’ toilets, sanitary pad disposal units, and safe transport—is a critical barrier. A 2018 ASER (Annual Status of Education Report) survey revealed that 23% of rural schools in India lacked usable girls&#8217; toilets. For many adolescent girls, this becomes a reason to drop out after puberty.</p>



<p>There’s also the issue of representation. According to UDISE+ 2021-22, only 47.2% of teachers in India are female. Having more women teachers has been shown to increase girls&#8217; enrolment and retention, especially in conservative communities.</p>



<p>And then there’s the curriculum itself. What girls learn should reflect their realities and aspirations, not just traditional gender roles. Incorporating life skills, digital literacy, reproductive health education, and vocational training can help make education more relevant and empowering.</p>



<p>Encouragingly, we have powerful examples to learn from. At <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Smile Foundation</a>, the <em><a href="https://donate.smilefoundationindia.org/donate-for-girl-child" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">She Can Fly</a></em> initiative is designed to integrate girl child education with nutrition, health, life skills, and family counselling. Girls are mentored, their families are sensitised, and local influencers are brought in to shift harmful gender norms. It’s an approach that recognises that educating a girl doesn’t happen in isolation but it’s a community transformation process.</p>



<p>These community-based models work. In districts where <em>She Can Fly</em> operates, dropout rates have fallen and confidence among adolescent girls has risen. Parents who once resisted education are now attending school events and planning for their daughters’ higher education. Change is possible but it requires consistent investment, cultural humility, and political will.</p>



<p>As India positions itself as a global economic leader, we must ask—what does growth mean if half our potential is left behind? The demographic dividend India hopes to capitalise on rests squarely on the shoulders of its young people. And no nation can afford to ignore its girls.</p>



<p>Educating India’s daughters is not a soft issue. It is a development imperative, a public health strategy, and a human rights obligation. And perhaps most importantly, it is the key to building a more inclusive, resilient, and prosperous India.</p>



<p>Let us move beyond slogans and symbols. Let us invest in policies, people, and programmes that do the hard work of changing hearts and systems. Let every girl in India learn, not because we owe her charity, but because she deserves the chance to lead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Indian constitution has made education a fundamental right. However, even today, millions of children are deprived of access to good-quality education because of socio-economic barriers, systemic inequalities, and general apathy. Within this problem, there is a larger problem that exists – the gap between girls and boys. The female literacy rate in India stands at 65.46%, significantly lower than the male literacy rate of 80.88%.</p>



<p>Over the years, several initiatives have ensured that the enrolment of girls in school gets improved. Even then, there are many inequalities that continue to persist. Also, the biggest problem is the retention of girls in the <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2445" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> system and their transition from school education to college education. This is because the drop-out rates for girls in higher education are more than that of men. This can be owed to factors like child marriage, societal stigma, sanitation facilities, security related issues, family pressure, etc. When the financial condition of a household is poor, it is often the girl child who has to take a step back from education and support in household chores. As per Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2022, 98 percent girls between the ages of 11 to 14 are enrolled in schools, but their <a href="https://www.collegesearch.in/articles/education-for-girls" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">dropout rates increase</a> as they enter higher grades.</p>



<p>This highlights the importance of ensuring that every girl has access to formal education and the barriers preventing that from happening need to be removed. Every girl deserves a classroom, as a space for learning, as a gateway to empowerment, equality, and opportunity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Importance of girl child education</strong></h2>



<p>While it is understood that education is crucial for growth and development of both girls and boys, and we are not suggesting that any one of them need to be prioritized more; why we are talking about education for girls is the systematic differences that exist between the two genders. Educating girls is both a matter of individual empowerment and also a tool of societal transformation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Here’s why girl child education is so important</strong></h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Independence and empowerment: </strong>Girls who receive proper education have the knowledge and skills to become financially independent and also to take informed decisions about their wellbeing. A financially independent woman can very well become the decision-maker of her life breaking away from her earlier assumed subservient roles.</li>



<li><strong><a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1441" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Health</a> and well-being: </strong>This is also true that girls who receive an education are able to make the right decisions when it comes to their health and well-being. Not just that, they also support their families in making the right decisions. This is because educated mothers are more likely to seek medical care for themselves and their children. This helps in reducing <a href="https://www.unicef.org/education/girls-education" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">maternal and child mortality rates</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Gender equality: </strong>This is a given; when girls are educated, they are able to stand shoulder to shoulder with boys. They challenge traditional gender roles and break stereotypes. For example, educated women may choose to support the family financially instead of taking care of the household. Education also empowers girls to assert their rights, seek legal help, and participate actively in the political and social sphere.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Broader impact of educating girls</strong></h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Economic Growth: </strong>When women receive good education, they are able to enter the workforce, become entrepreneurs, and also bring new innovation to the industries they work in. This way, they help the nation’s economy to grow at a faster pace. According to the World Bank, closing gender gaps in education and <a href="https://www.rawatgirlscollege.com/blog/importance-of-girl-education-in-india" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">labour force participation</a> could add $12 trillion to global GDP by 2025.</li>



<li><strong>Development of Society:</strong> When it comes to participation in community development, public discourse, or fighting for social change and challenging harmful practices, the ones who are empowered can do it. Educated girls are more likely to challenge harmful practices like child marriage, gender-based violence, etc. This way they help in creating a more inclusive society.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Society’s moral obligation towards girls</strong></h2>



<p>All of us have a moral obligation to ensure every girl in this country finds a classroom. Educating children is a matter of justice, dignity, and human rights. When we deny our girls access to education, we perpetuate the cycle of discrimination, inequality, and social injustice.</p>



<p>There are a number of initiatives that have been taken in India to ensure that girl education is promoted.&nbsp;</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP):</strong> Launched in 2015, this government programme aims to address the declining child sex ratio and promote education and empowerment of girls. It focuses on awareness campaigns, community mobilization, and improving access to education.</li>



<li><strong>Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBV): </strong>This scheme provides <a href="https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/empowering-nations-educating-girls-for-economic-growth-and-equality" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">residential schools</a> for girls from disadvantaged communities, ensuring access to quality education in rural and backward areas.</li>



<li><strong>Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY): </strong>A <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/girl-child-education-for-economic-growth-and-equality/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">savings scheme</a> that encourages families to invest in their daughters’ education and future, offering financial security and incentives.</li>



<li><strong>National Scheme of Incentives to Girls for Secondary Education (NSIGSE): </strong>This programme provides <a href="https://dsel.education.gov.in/nsigse" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">financial incentives</a> to girls from marginalized communities to complete secondary education.</li>
</ol>



<p>Apart from these initiatives by the government, there are many contributions made by non-government organizations (NGOs) and the private sector as well. There are several initiatives that work towards ensuring good quality education for not just girls, but every child.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The way forward: What needs to be done for girl child</strong></h2>



<p>Apart from ensuring access to education and classrooms, we also need to work towards maintaining the quality of this education, creating employment opportunities, and much more. Here are some of the things that need urgent attention:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>The primary focus should be on reducing the dropout rate for girls as they reach higher grades. This can only be addressed through awareness campaigns, community involvement, and providing incentives for families to support their girl child’s education until she receives higher education. Providing scholarships, menstrual hygiene products, and safe transportation can make a significant difference.</li>



<li>Secondly, there is a major need to invest in education infrastructure so that more and more schools and higher education institutions of quality are present across the country, and the girls do not have to travel long distances to receive education. Additionally, libraries and digital classrooms should be established in existing institutions as well.</li>



<li>Leverage technology to provide online learning opportunities and bridge the digital divide. Initiatives like Digital India can be expanded to include e-learning platforms for girls in remote areas.</li>



<li>Since educating girls is not dependent on just one person, we need to involve parents and community leaders in promoting this. As mentioned above, awareness campaigns need to be run and incentives need to be created for families.</li>



<li>Lastly, the most important is the continuous strengthening of policies that support and promote education of girls. Also, the existing policies need to be implemented in a better way so that there are no gaps that exist. Regular monitoring and evaluation is also needed to assess the impact of the initiatives, and changes should be made according to the need.</li>
</ol>



<p>Every girl deserves a classroom—not just as a space for learning but as a platform for empowerment, equality, and opportunity. Educating girls is not just an investment in their future but a commitment to building a better world for all. It is a moral obligation, an economic necessity, and a social imperative. As India strives to achieve its development goals, <a href="https://donate.smilefoundationindia.org/donate-for-girl-child" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">prioritizing girl child education</a> will be key to unlocking the nation’s full potential.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each year, on 14th April, India solemnly celebrates Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Jayanti, marking the birth anniversary of the principal architect of the Indian Constitution and a tireless champion for social justice. As we observe Ambedkar Jayanti 2025, it becomes essential to reflect not only on his monumental contributions but also on the relevance of his ideals—liberty, equality, and fraternity—in our modern-day context. His enduring vision continues to guide movements for social reform and inspire institutions, including numerous NGOs in India, which strive to build an inclusive and just society.</p>
<h3><b>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar: A Visionary for the Marginalised</b></h3>
<p>Born in 1891 into a marginalised Dalit family,<a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1916229" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> Dr Ambedkar’s life</a> was a testament to resilience and intellectual brilliance. Rising above entrenched discrimination, he emerged as a formidable scholar, economist, and social reformer. His most historic achievement—drafting the Indian Constitution—laid the groundwork for a democratic republic rooted in equality, justice, and human dignity.</p>
<p>Central to Dr. Ambedkar’s philosophy was the belief that <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2442" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> and economic empowerment were essential to dismantling social hierarchies. He championed Dalit rights, fought for women’s emancipation, and emphasised the necessity of labour reforms, shaping policies that still resonate in India’s socio-political framework.</p>
<h3><b>Why Ambedkar’s ideals still matter in 2025</b></h3>
<p>Even in today’s India, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar’s teachings hold profound significance. Social inequities, caste-based discrimination, and economic disparity persist, making his principles a roadmap to address the challenges of our time:</p>
<h4><strong><i>1. Social Justice and Equal Opportunity</i></strong></h4>
<p>Unequal resources and opportunities remains a challenging reality, particularly in rural and underserved communities. Dr. Ambedkar’s advocacy for affirmative action and reservation policies has enabled countless individuals to access education and employment. Yet, ongoing efforts are vital to extend these opportunities universally.</p>
<h4><strong><i>2. Education as a Catalyst for Change</i></strong></h4>
<p>Dr. Ambedkar famously declared education as the<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/4899410.pdf?abstractid=4899410&amp;mirid=1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> “milk of a lioness,”</a> urging the oppressed to pursue learning with courage. In the digital era, educational inequity remains a challenge, especially in rural India. His call for inclusive and quality education remains ever-relevant.</p>
<h4><strong><i>3. Economic Empowerment and Livelihood</i></strong></h4>
<p>His commitment to economic justice—through land reforms, wage security, and employment opportunities—serves as a cornerstone for current policies targeting poverty alleviation and inclusive growth. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/smile-foundation_tayyarikalki-activity-7312814918062194689-8W6g?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAC5evssB-CzXX8WTwACOEZZ4RFtymRGUt_s" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Livelihood programmes</a> that provide vocational training and promote self-employment are clear extensions of his vision.</p>
<h4><strong><i>4. Women’s Rights and Gender Equality</i></strong></h4>
<p>Dr. Ambedkar was one of the earliest advocates for<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/smile-foundation_swabhiman-womenempowerment-financialindependence-activity-7309920002260799488-mG_O?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAC5evssB-CzXX8WTwACOEZZ4RFtymRGUt_s" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> women’s rights</a>, championing reforms that granted them agency in marriage, property, and employment. Today, his legacy lives on through initiatives that seek to ensure equal pay, reproductive rights, and political representation for women.</p>
<h4><strong><i>5. Democracy and Constitutional Morality</i></strong></h4>
<p>In an age of global political flux, Dr. Ambedkar’s belief in constitutional morality and democratic governance is more relevant than ever. His insistence on upholding civil liberties and secular values offers crucial guidance in preserving the spirit of Indian democracy.</p>
<h3><b>How NGOs in India continue to uphold Ambedkar’s vision</b></h3>
<p>Across the country, NGOs in India remain committed to carrying forward Dr. Ambedkar’s legacy. Smile Foundation too works towards bringing change for good at the grassroot communities of India, aligning its efforts with his principles through a holistic and integrated approach to development.</p>
<p>Founded in 2005,<a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow"> Smile Foundation</a> quickly recognised that education alone could not guarantee the holistic development of underprivileged children. We understood that systemic barriers—starting with poor maternal and neonatal care—impacted a child’s ability to thrive from the earliest stages of life.</p>
<p>From lack of healthcare to limited access to trained educators and infrastructure, children in rural and marginalised communities face multifaceted obstacles. Financial hardship often compels families to withdraw children—especially girls—from school, while undernutrition and poor sanitation perpetuate cycles of poverty and vulnerability.</p>
<p>In response, <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/need-based-approach-of-smile-foundation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Smile Foundation adopted a life-cycle approach</a> to address the interlinked issues affecting individuals and communities by offering integrated solutions in education, healthcare, and livelihood.</p>
<h3><b>The life-cycle approach: Nurturing change from cradle to career and beyond</b></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Mission Education aligns with the <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/learning-how-to-learn-national-education-policy-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">National Education Policy</a>, focusing on foundational literacy, numeracy, and STEM disciplines, ensuring children develop strong cognitive and critical thinking skills.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Smile on Wheels mobile <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1438" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> units bring essential medical services, including diagnostics, outpatient care, and free medication, to under-resourced communities.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Swabhiman champions maternal, menstrual, and neonatal health, creating awareness about hygiene and equipping women with knowledge crucial for their wellbeing.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">STeP and advanced vocational training programmes empower youth and women with the skills required for employment and entrepreneurship, thus enhancing economic self-sufficiency.</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Ambedkar’s ideals and the life-cycle approach: A shared vision</b></h3>
<p>Dr. Ambedkar envisioned an India where every citizen, regardless of birth, had the chance to realise their full potential. His insistence on structural reform, access to education, economic equity, and gender equality finds deep resonance in Smile Foundation’s life-cycle approach.</p>
<p>Both stand for a future where transformation is not episodic, but continuous—built layer by layer, across generations and therefore, as we mark the 134th Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Jayanti in 2025, let us do more than remember his legacy—let us live it. </p>
<p>Let’s build a society where equality is not an aspiration but a reality. <a href="https://donate.smilefoundationindia.org/donate-for-education/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Support children with education </a>and their communities an empowered life. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Child marriage has been a pressing social issue in India since decades. Even though there has been incredible progress in reducing such cases, the practice still persists in some parts of the country, especially those areas which struggle with issues of poverty, poor education, social divides, etc. Child marriage, in turn, perpetuate this cycle of poverty and inequality because it stops young girls from accessing education and takes away their agency.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/maternal-mortality-rate-of-100-deaths-per-one-lakh-live-births-achieved-health-minister/article69290100.ece" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">National Family Health Survey</a> (NFHS-5), India has made strides in reducing child marriage, yet approximately 23% of women aged 20-24 were married before the age of 18. For someone living in urban India, child marriage may seem like a problem of the past. However, it is an extremely sad reality for those girls who have to bear its brunt. Therefore, it is crucial that we talk about the problem of child brides in India and its relationship with the maternal and child mortality rates.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Child brides and maternal mortality in India</strong></h2>



<p>As India has grown in the last few years and decades, it has managed to bring down its child and maternal mortality rates. According to the <a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/maternal-mortality-and-india-s-multifold-challenges-3435822" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Sample Registration System</a> (SRS) 2020 report, the under-five mortality rate (U5MR) in India declined to 32 deaths per 1,000 live births, while the infant mortality rate (IMR) dropped to 28 deaths per 1,000 live births. At the same time, <a href="https://www.thehansindia.com/life-style/health/se-asia-sees-decline-in-maternal-mortality-ratio-on-track-to-achieve-sdg-target-by-2030-who-951784" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">maternal mortality ratio</a> (MMR) has also seen a decline from 398 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1997-98 to 103 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2017-19.</p>



<p>These are positive numbers and worth celebrating, but the challenge is that India is still behind in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of reducing under-five mortality rate to 25 and maternal mortality rate to 70 by the year 2030. In a fast-growing economy like India, it is fair to expect that the problem of child mortality and maternal mortality is brought down to a level that becomes almost negligible or is completely eliminated.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Link between child brides and mortality rates</strong></h2>



<p>Now that we understand where India stands when it comes to maternal mortality rate and child mortality rate, it is important that we look at the link between these and the problem of child brides. First of all, child marriage is not the sole or the biggest reason for high mortality rates. There are several factors that contribute to it, like poor access to nutrition and healthcare facilities, lack of awareness, etc.</p>



<p>However, child marriage does play a role in contributing to high child and maternal mortality rates in India. Girls who marry before the age of 18 are more likely to experience early pregnancies, which pose significant <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1426" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> risks for both the mother and the child. Early pregnancies are associated with complications such as preeclampsia, obstructed labour, and low birth weight, all of which increase the risk of maternal and neonatal mortality.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2003432" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">study in the BMJ</a>, the children who are born to mothers who were married when they were minors are at a higher risk of stunting, malnutrition, etc. As mentioned above, the problem is exacerbated because of lack of access to education, nutrition, and proper healthcare. Child brides are more likely to have poorer access to these facilities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ending child marriage in India</strong></h2>



<p>Now that we understand the link between child marriage and maternal and child mortality rates, we must talk about the solutions. Here are some key strategies that can be adopted:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong><a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2430" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Education</a> access – </strong>The first and most important change agent is access to good quality education to children, irrespective of their gender. When children, especially girls, get access to education, they are less likely to be married off at an early age. In India, initiatives like the <em>Beti Bachao Beti Padhao</em> campaign aim to promote girls&#8217; education and empower them to make informed decisions about their lives.</li>



<li><strong>Economic empowerment – </strong>The second important step is to improve the economic status of people in India as lack of resources is one of the biggest reasons why poor parents decide to marry off their daughters. Therefore, it is important that investment is made in the area of providing employment opportunities, skilling, and supporting grassroots entrepreneurs.</li>



<li><strong>Community engagement –</strong> While child marriage is an issue that is rooted in problems of poverty and lack of education, it is also a social ill that disguises as a tradition. Therefore, it is important that community leaders at local level, religious figures, and youth are engaged to change the perceptions of people around this issue.</li>



<li><strong>Legal framework &#8211;</strong> Strengthening and enforcing laws against child marriage is essential. The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA) 2006 sets the legal age of marriage at 18 for girls and 21 for boys. However, gaps in enforcement and lack of awareness about the law remain challenges. Efforts to raise the legal age of marriage for girls to 21 are currently underway, which could further deter the practice.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Initiatives in India</strong></h2>



<p>The country has taken many initiatives over the years to deal with this problem, including policy frameworks, awareness campaigns, and even television shows. Let’s look at some of the initiatives taken to erase the problems of child and maternal mortality in India:</p>



<p><strong>Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA) 2006:</strong> It criminalizes child marriage and provides penalties for those who facilitate or participate in the practice.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p=b5e5d60dacec0f79601cfe36ba155cde6b056fc5da9e21b201ee24708094707dJmltdHM9MTc0MTU2NDgwMA&amp;ptn=3&amp;ver=2&amp;hsh=4&amp;fclid=3586fdc9-1e4b-60db-3674-ed4d1fc061e0&amp;psq=kishori+shakti+yojana&amp;u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kaWEuZ292LmluL2tpc2hvcmktc2hha3RpLXlvamFuYS1taW5pc3RyeS13b21lbi1hbmQtY2hpbGQtZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQ&amp;ntb=1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kishori Shakti Yojana</strong></a><strong>:</strong> This scheme aims to empower adolescent girls through education, nutrition, and life skills training, reducing their vulnerability to child marriage.</p>



<p><strong>Childline 1098:</strong> The helpline provides a platform for reporting cases of child marriage and rescuing at-risk children.</p>



<p><strong>National Health Mission (NHM): </strong>The NHM includes programs like Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) and Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA), which focus on improving maternal and child health through financial incentives and free healthcare services.</p>



<p>Apart from these, various initiatives have been taken by international organizations like UNICEF, NGOs including Smile Foundation, and corporations through their CSR initiatives.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>Elimination of child marriage in India is not just about reducing child and maternal mortality rates, but it is also a moral imperative and a step towards reducing the inequalities that exist in our society. What we need is to begin by addressing the root cause of the problem and then employ targeted interventions. Education, economic empowerment, community engagement, and strong legal frameworks are key to achieving this goal. In this journey, the role played by the government, NGOs, and private sector is equally important. Therefore, we must <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">join our hands together</a> and support any initiative that aims to fight this problem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Do you know that the Nobel Prize, one of the prestigious awards bestowed to those who conferred the greatest benefits to humankind, was bestowed 627 times to 1,012 people and organizations between 1901 and 2024? The number stands as high as 976 individuals and 28 organizations after deducting redundancy. But are you aware that the number of women who bagged the award remains critically low? The number is just 65. The number shrinks to 25 if we calculate the number of women who bagged awards in science—physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine. </p>



<p>Despite the gender gap in the field, we also need to acknowledge that there has been a study raise in the number of girls in science. And, it always calls for celebration. Only by celebrating women who reach the pinnacle of their scientific careers can we encourage girls in school to take up science. Else, they go back to their cages without defying gender stereotypes. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why are girls in STEM always good news?</strong></h2>



<p>People, quite often, question when the world celebrates a woman who reaches the top of her scientific career more than a man. It is simply because men are freely allowed to concentrate on their careers and personal growth. But for women, a career is just one of the numerous things that she needs to focus on. Often, women were forced to put a full stop to their careers and personal growth to excel in other things. That’s why the recognition of women in science is celebrated as good news. Below are some of the reasons why our hearts ache to see much more good news.</p>



<p><strong>1. Challenging stereotypes:</strong> Historically, women have been discouraged from pursuing a career, especially in STEM. It has always been seen as a career option for men. Even those who fight odds are allowed to take up only caregiving jobs like nursing, teaching, sewing, and mending. As a result, the field has always been underrepresented by women. When a woman excels in the field, it means that she has challenged outdated stereotypes and gender biases. Her achievements demonstrate that talent and innovation are not bound by gender.</p>



<p><strong>2. Inspiring future generations:</strong> When young girls witness women succeeding in science, they change their perspective. It will help them to break down the mental barriers that had discouraged them from pursuing such careers or defying gender stereotypes. Role models will significantly influence a person’s choices, and seeing women in prominent science roles encourages more diverse participation in fields traditionally dominated by men.</p>



<p><strong>3. Diverse perspectives lead to better innovation:</strong> Studies have proved that diversity—people from different backgrounds, genders, cultures, and experiences—will lead to creative problem-solving and innovation. When multiple angles are given to a problem, a wider range of potential solutions can be arrived at earlier. This in turn can result in more creative and well-rounded innovations. In a similar way, women would have a unique perspective and approach to research. It in turn will lead to breakthroughs that may have been overlooked otherwise.</p>



<p><strong>4. Equality and empowerment:</strong> When a woman succeeds in science, she inspires a lot of girls to pursue science. This in turn paves the path not only for women&#8217;s empowerment but also for ensuring equality in the field. Since women will help shift the culture in academia, research institutions, and industries, these spaces will also become more inclusive and open to future generations of scientists, regardless of gender.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Facts and figures about women in science</strong></h2>



<p>Below are some of the facts and figures about women in science as listed by the United Nations and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).</p>



<p>1. Only one in three scientists across the globe are women.</p>



<p>2. Less than two out of five STEM graduates are women. Women account for just 28% of engineering graduates and 40% in computer science and informatics.</p>



<p>3. Women hold just 22% of STEM jobs in G20 countries.</p>



<p>4. Only 12% of national academies of science members are women.</p>



<p>5. The percentage of women scientists has gone up to 31.7% in 2021 from 30% in 2017 worldwide. The percentage still remains in South and West Asia in the last decade.</p>



<p>6. There is not much improvement in analyzing and gathering data regarding the share of female researchers in the last decade. Not all countries have reliable data on gender and science.</p>



<p>7. One in two women scientists has reported experiencing sexual harassment at the workplace, as per a 2022 study.</p>



<p>8. Only one in five professionals, i.e., just 22%, are women in cutting-edge fields, including artificial intelligence.</p>



<p>9. The gender gap continues to widen as women advance in their scientific careers.</p>



<p>10. Women are given smaller research grants than their counterparts.</p>



<p>11. Only 25 women scientists have bagged the Nobel Prize to date. Of which, Marie Curie remains the only woman who bagged the award twice—physics in 1903 and chemistry in 1911.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ways to close the gender gap in science</strong></h2>



<p>Despite the evident progress women have made in science, the gender gap continues to exist, and men dominate the field without much difficulty. Closing the historical gender gap requires a multi-faceted approach to help women tackle numerous barriers throughout their academic and professional careers. Below are some of the ways to help reduce the gender gap.</p>



<p><strong>1. Encourage early STEM <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2421" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> for girls:</strong> Materials that often portray male examples of scientists and engineers and women depicted as teachers and nurses should be removed from school books. Since people’s aspirations are framed from an early age, including gender-neutral language in textbooks, lectures, and scientific papers becomes vital. Family members and teachers should encourage girls to explore their interest in science, even as they assist them to challenge societal stereotypes. To spark interest and confidence in young girls, they should be encouraged to engage with STEM activities from an early age. Girls should be allowed to participate in programmes like coding clubs, science fairs, and robotic competitions without any gender-based restrictions.</p>



<p><strong>2. Mentorship and networking:</strong> Most of the time, girls opt out of pursuing careers because they don’t get the right support at the right time. The field does not have many mentorship programmes that are tailored to support girls. Since many are not allowed to travel out of their city to attend mentorship programmes or broaden their networking connections, they lack mentorship opportunities. This often puts women with less or no mentorship. Also networking space has historically been dominated by men and it has always been aligned with the interests and priorities of men. When a woman enters the male-dominated domain, she is often looked down upon. Without proper guidance and a lack of networks, women often stall before collapsing completely. By offering mentorship and networking opportunities, a greater number of girls can be brought into the field. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>3. Retaining women in the workforce:</strong> Even as we work towards bringing in more girls into science, we should also put equal effort into retaining women in the workforce by addressing their challenges. Women in the workforce are often paid less, and have few chances of getting promotion. The World Bank suggests, “policies that encourage retention such as flexible work, paid family leave, and childcare support will benefit both women, men, and employers and are particularly crucial.” By retaining women, we are not just moving towards gender equality at the workplace but also encouraging numerous other girls to pursue careers in the field.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smile’s Work</strong></h3>



<p>Smile Foundation has been actively promoting STEM education among girls, recognizing the importance of bridging the gender gap in these fields. In collaboration with various partners, the foundation has launched several initiatives to empower young women in STEM.</p>



<p><strong>Engineering Scholarship Programs:</strong> Smile Foundation, in partnership with organizations like Deutsche Bank, Quantiphi, Quest Global, and Siemens, offers scholarship programs targeting female engineering students. These programs provide financial assistance, essential learning tools such as laptops, employability and communication training, internships, and industry exposure. Currently, over 2,000 students benefit from these initiatives, aiming to increase female representation in high-growth sectors.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>STEM Labs and Mobile Learning:</strong> In collaboration with BMW India Foundation, Smile Foundation has established state-of-the-art STEM laboratories in government-aided schools across Delhi NCR. Additionally, a &#8216;STEM on Wheels&#8217; mobile lab has been introduced to reach students in smaller community schools. These labs are equipped with modern tools and technologies, providing hands-on learning experiences to foster creativity and problem-solving skills among students. This initiative engages around 2,500 students annually, promoting inclusivity in STEM fields, particularly for underprivileged children.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through these initiatives, Smile Foundation is actively working to empower girls in STEM, providing them with the necessary resources, support, and opportunities to excel in these fields.</p>



<p>Despite the progress made in the field, science is still dominated by men. To include more women in the field and walk towards gender equality, the workspace needs to become more inclusive, girls should be exposed to STEM at an early age, and societal stereotypes should be challenged without apologies. For this to happen, the world needs to celebrate the women in science, and it should always remain good news.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good health is a fundamental human right and an essential need for all. It holds particular significance for women, especially those in rural areas. In rural India, women not only bear the responsibility of caring for their children and families while managing household chores, but they also play a crucial role in the labour force and agriculture. Their active participation contributes to family income, national development, and the agricultural sector.</p>



<p>The impact of nutrition on their <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1414" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> is not only vital for their well-being but also has a ripple effect on their families and broader economic activities. Poor health resulting from inadequate nutrition diminishes their ability to care for their families and significantly reduces their earning potential. An inadequate intake of nutrients could lead to malnutrition and deficiency diseases, and make women prone to certain ailments. Lower health status manifests itself in:</p>



<p>a) lower life expectancy,</p>



<p>b) higher rates of morbidity and mortality,</p>



<p>c) lower levels of productivity, and</p>



<p>d) a decreased ability to earn and support</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Nutrition deficiency impact&#8217;s on rural women</strong></h2>



<p>While maternal morbidity and several women-related health challenges arising due to nutrition deficiency remain a global challenge, for rural women, the effects are disproportionate. Patriarchal social structure, illiteracy, unskilled labour, financial dependence, gender discrimination, early marriage and multiple pregnancies, hard physical labour, lack of awareness and access to safe healthcare, and poverty<em> </em>are only a few factors that largely rule the lives of rural women.</p>



<p>All of these factors hinder their access to proper intake of nutrition which are again exacerbated by pregnancy-related issues and other reproductive health issues and while this continues, it also restricts them to the four walls of their house, restricting their financial mobility- creating a vicious cycle of poor nutrition, health, and economic dependence.</p>



<p>The impact of nutritional deficiency among rural women is far-reaching.</p>



<p>Here are a few:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Low weight and height:</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>The majority of young women from lower socioeconomic groups suffer from undernutrition, primarily as a result of these communities&#8217; females not fulfilling their nutritional needs as they enter puberty. This subsequently, leads to low body weight and stunted height, unable to grow to their full potential. Malnutrition impairs the healthy development of the pelvis and causes stunted growth. By the time a girl reaches adolescence, she still has around 4% of her height to gain and 12–18% of her pelvis to expand.</p>



<p>Further, teenage pregnancy and early marriage impede her growth. Therefore, these women are classified as &#8220;high risk&#8221; because they are more likely to experience obstetric problems and give birth to low birth weight (LBW) babies, which raises the possibility of higher infant mortality and morbidity.</p>



<p>2. <strong>Maternal mortality:</strong></p>



<p>Approximately 25% of maternal deaths worldwide are caused by pregnancy and stillbirth-related factors, which claim the lives of over 100,000 women in the nation, each year. According to the <a target="_blank" href="http://UN MMEIG 2020 report" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">UN MMEIG 2020 report,</a> <em>Trends in Maternal Mortality 2000 to 2020</em>, India’s MMR has significantly reduced from 384 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 103 in 2020. In comparison, the global MMR has decreased from 339 to 223 over the same period.</p>



<p>Haemorrhage (prenatal and postnatal), toxaemia (pregnancy-related hypertension), anaemia, obstructed labour, puerperal sepsis (postpartum infections), and botched abortion are the main causes of these deaths, which are doubled due to lack of proper nutrition intake.</p>



<p>For rural women, the burden of uncontrolled fertility, insufficient prenatal care, and a shortage of qualified delivery attendants act as a double whammy and become the primary causes of increased maternal mortality. The poor nutrition status of rural women doubled with the sociocultural attitudes and gender discrimination are indirectly linked to increasing mortality rate.</p>



<p>3. <strong>Anemia:</strong></p>



<p>Women have a higher need of iron than men and, are impacted disproportionately by a lack of proper nutrients. Anaemia is the most common nutritional deficiency seen among Indian women, especially those from the lower socio-economic groups,&nbsp; and the most common cause for it is the deficiency of iron and, to a lesser extent, folic acid. Iron is required essentially for the formulation of haemoglobin, which is the carrier of oxygen in our blood. This often causes shortness of breath, pale colour of eyes and nails and reduction in capacity to work.</p>



<p>The majority of women see a decline in haemoglobin levels as their pregnancy progresses, and pregnancy is a time of nutritional stress. Repeated pregnancies, blood loss during menstruation, poor diet, and a lack of iron supplements in rural women also affect the haemoglobin levels. Anaemia (RGI) bleeding during pregnancy and puerperium are thought to be responsible for 40% of all maternal fatalities in rural settings. The latter indirectly leads to death, but it also reflects the severe repercussions of nutritional deficiency in rural Indian health conditions.</p>



<p>Therefore, it is not too difficult to understand the rising numbers of malnutrition across the globe, both among women and children. Iron deficiency anaemia adversely affects maternal and foetal well-being and is linked to increased morbidity and foetal death. Infants and children with iron deficiency anaemia are at risk of developmental difficulties involving cognitive, social-emotional, and adaptive functions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Nutritional Development with Swabhiman</strong></h3>



<p>With the belief that women are the cornerstone of a community, Smile Foundation&#8217;s women empowerment initiative- <a target="_blank" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/women-empowerment/" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Swabhiman </a>works closely on the enhancement of maternal and reproductive healthcare of women their children and young girls.</p>



<p>One of the key elements of our program is to give the underserved women of India, the knowledge and adaptability of habits that enhance their nutritional development. Through regular awareness camps, practical activities and working hand-in-hand with Aanganwadi workers in India, Swabhiman supports the values and visions of the government towards women&#8217;s health in India.</p>



<p>For example, Smile Foundation organised an awareness camp in Greater Noida to mark the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=725466579604487&amp;set=pcb.725466679604477" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">&#8220;Rashtriya Poshan Maah celebration&#8221;</a> in partnership with our esteemed partners, where women of the community were provided with information and habits that improve the Antenatal Care (ANC) and the importance of maternal health and its connection to nutrition.</p>

<p>The idea of a gender-equal society by 2030 is a bold goal set by the United Nations under <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal5" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5</a>: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. But with just a few years left, can we truly create a world where gender no longer dictates opportunities, safety, or rights?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Mrs.</em></strong>&#8211; a recent 2025 film that has taken center stage in conversations about gender, challenges deep-seated societal expectations of women. More than just a movie, it reflects the struggles many women face in balancing ambition with societal norms, mirroring real-world inequalities. It reminds us that gender equality, more than being about progressive policies, is also about changing deep-rooted biases.</p>



<p>Despite undeniable progress in <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2410" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a>, employment, and lawmaking, gender discrimination, pay gaps, violence, and stereotypes are still widespread. So, can we achieve this milestone by 2030, or is it an idealistic dream?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Education: The Foundation of Gender Equality</strong></h2>



<p>Education is often cited as the key to breaking gender-based discrimination, and for a good reason. Countries that have prioritized equal educational access for all genders have seen remarkable improvements in economic growth, healthcare outcomes, and overall social development. According to <a href="https://www.unesco.org/gem-report/en/2022-out-school" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">UNESCO</a>, globally, 118.5 million girls of primary and secondary school age are out of school, with sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia facing the largest gaps. In India, while gender parity in primary education is improving, dropout rates for girls increase significantly at the secondary level due to societal pressures, early marriage, and safety concerns. A survey found that nearly <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/57-of-girl-students-drop-out-of-schools-by-class-xi-report/articleshow/66900622.cms" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">30% of girl students</a> drop out of schools by the time they get to class IX and the number rises to 57% in class XI, limiting future opportunities.</p>



<p>To bridge this gap, access to quality education must be non-negotiable. Gender-sensitive curriculum, scholarships, and mentorship programs tailored for marginalized communities can open doors. Skill-building initiatives, particularly in STEM and leadership, can further close the opportunity gap. The Government of India has launched initiatives like <a href="https://www.jncasr.ac.in/outreach/GATI" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">GATI (Gender Advancement for Transforming Institutions</a>) to boost women&#8217;s participation in STEM and PM-USP Yojana to provide scholarships and reduce dropout rates.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Beyond the Pay Gap</strong></h2>



<p>Financial independence is one of the strongest weapons against gender disparity. Yet, women and non-binary individuals still earn less, face hiring discrimination, and have fewer leadership opportunities. According to the <a href="https://frontline.thehindu.com/news/131-years-more-to-close-global-gender-gap-world-economic-forum-report/article67146483.ece#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20report&#039;s%20analysis,in%20their%20gender%20parity%20scores." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">World Economic Forum’s 2023 Global Gender Gap Report</a>, closing the gender gap in economic participation at the current rate will take a staggering 131 years. Less than <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/02/india-buses-women-economic-success/#:~:text=Less%20than%2025%25%20of%20the,female%20participation%20in%20the%20workforce?" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">25% of the Indian workforce is female</a> and the contribution of women to India’s GDP is just 18%, one of the lowest proportions in the world.</p>



<p>The solution? Focused policies on <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" title="Livelihood" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="668" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">skill development</a>, equal pay laws, and better workplace support. India has seen some progress with initiatives like the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, but further action such as stronger paternity leave policies and stricter enforcement of workplace harassment laws are needed to create truly inclusive work environments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Improving Healthcare Accessibility</strong> <strong>for Gender Equality</strong></h2>



<p>Gender disparity in healthcare remains a significant issue in India, where women often face limited access to medical services, higher malnutrition rates, and inadequate reproductive care. The statistics are staggering: India’s maternal mortality rate (97 per 100,000 live births) is higher than in developed nations. Over 50% of<a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1795421" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> Indian women aged 15-49 suffer from anemia</a>, affecting maternal and child health. In India, the National Family Health Survey <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/30-women-in-india-subjected-to-physical-sexual-violence-nfhs-7906029/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">(NFHS-5)</a> reports that 29.3% of married women have faced domestic violence, and access to mental health services remains inadequate, particularly in rural areas.</p>



<p>Healthcare systems must be redesigned with gender in mind. Countries like Argentina, which have integrated gender-affirming healthcare policies, show what’s possible. India has made progress with initiatives like Ayushman Bharat, but expanding gender-sensitive services and tackling deep-rooted healthcare discrimination is crucial.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gender-Based Violence</strong></h3>



<p>Despite stricter laws and increasing awareness, gender-based violence remains a major hurdle to achieving gender parity. The <a href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/ending-violence-against-women-day" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">UN reports that an estimated 736 million women</a>—almost one in three—have faced intimate partner or sexual violence. In India, fast-track courts for sexual violence cases and policies like the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act have helped, but underreporting and stigma still prevent many survivors from seeking justice.</p>



<p>Solutions go beyond laws; they require cultural shifts. More support services for survivors, including mental <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1412" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> counseling and financial aid, can make a difference. Countries like Spain, which have gender violence courts and immediate response teams, offer effective models that India and other nations can adapt.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Seat at the Table, or Many Seats at the Table</strong></h2>



<p>For real change, women and non-binary individuals must have a voice in decision-making spaces. Globally, only <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2023/03/women-in-politics-map-2023" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">26.5% of parliamentary seats</a> are held by women. In India, women make up just <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/research/with-14-women-lok-sabha-members-india-still-behind-its-neighbours-9336769/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">14% of the Lok Sabha</a>, far from equal representation.</p>



<p>Affirmative action policies can help. <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/women-parliament-representation-rwanda-8947305/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Rwanda, with 61% female parliamentary representation,</a> sets a strong example of how political will can drive change. More inclusive leadership results in better policies, fairer budgets, and faster progress toward gender equity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smile’s Work</strong> <strong>for Gender Equality</strong></h2>



<p>Smile Foundation is actively engaged in promoting gender equality through various initiatives:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Swabhiman Programme</strong>: This initiative focuses on <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/women-empowerment/" title="Women Empowerment" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="472" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">women empowerment</a> by providing digital financial literacy, health awareness, and entrepreneurship training. It aims to equip women with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate the digital financial landscape effectively.<br></li>



<li><strong>Project Manzil</strong>: In Rajasthan, this project has provided counseling and employability skills training to over 90,000 young girls, enhancing their prospects for a better future.<br></li>



<li><a href="https://donate.smilefoundationindia.org/donate-for-girl-child" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow"><strong>She Can Fly Campaign</strong></a>: This effort is designed to enable, equip, and empower underprivileged girl children with quality education, proper nutrition, good health, adequate skills, and self-confidence. The campaign supports more than 400,000 girls and women annually, offering education support to over 27,000 girls and healthcare support to more than 300,000 girls and women through mobile healthcare units.<br></li>



<li><strong>Smile Twin E-learning Programme (STeP)</strong>: This program trains underprivileged youth in English, computer skills, soft skills, and other necessary competencies. To date, more than 10,000 youths have been trained, with over 6400 placed in various brands across India. Notably, more than half of the beneficiaries are girls, highlighting the program&#8217;s commitment to gender inclusivity.</li>
</ul>



<p>Through these comprehensive programs, Smile Foundation strives to create a gender-equal society by addressing educational disparities, enhancing employability, and empowering women and girls across India.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Will We Get There by 2030?</strong></h3>



<p>Beyond laws and policies, societal attitudes must evolve to achieve gender equality in true form. Traditional gender roles still dominate, limiting aspirations and opportunities. The media, digital platforms, and education play key roles in shaping gender norms. However, India still struggles with a digital gender divide—only <a href="https://india.unfpa.org/en/news/stage-has-been-set-gender-equity-digital-india#:~:text=As%20per%20the%20National%20Family,(49%25%20vs%2025%25)." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">33% of internet users are women</a>, limiting access to online education and job opportunities.</p>



<p>The way we raise children matters too. Teaching boys and girls the same values, giving them equal responsibilities, and breaking gender stereotypes in schools and workplaces can lead to a more balanced future. So, Can we achieve a gender-equal society by 2030? The honest answer is—it’s unlikely. But that doesn’t mean the fight should slow down. The key lies in an integrated approach: change is possible when there is collective action and political will.</p>



<p>We may not get there by 2030, but we can ensure that gender equality is a reality in the making- every single day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The United Nations has observed a significant decline in child marriages in South Asian countries and named India as one of the significant contributors. Going in line with the data, union women and children development minister Annapurna Devi recently revealed that child marriages halved in the country. The number has dropped from 47.4% in 2006 to 23.3% in 2019-21. The facts don’t mean that child marriages are abolished in the country. It just means that the number has come down.</p>



<p>The minister has also shared that one in five girls is married before turning 18 years, and they had stopped at least two lakh early marriages in the last year in the country. Indian families continue to marry their girl children at an early stage despite numerous warnings both from the government and experts. Why do they refuse to give up their attempts? Why marriage can never be an ally of young girls. Let’s understand in detail.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is early marriage?</strong></h2>



<p>Early marriage is a practice that involves marrying off individuals, mainly girls, before they reach the legal age of marriage. It has been prevalent in the country for centuries together. Families married off their wards at the earliest, and sometimes even before the girl hit puberty. But the British government passed the Child Marriage Restraint Act in 1929 to stop early marriages. The law insisted that a girl should at least be 14 years old, and a boy should be 18 years old to get married. Since the Muslim community opposed it, a separate law has been passed for them.</p>



<p>After the independence, the Child Marriage Restraint Act was amended twice. In 1949, the age limit was increased to 15 for girls, and in 1978, the age limit was increased to 18 for women and 21 for men. Since people continued marrying their girls at much younger ages, the government passed the prohibition of child marriage act in 2006.</p>



<p>According to the act, a child means a person who, if a male, has not completed 21 years of age, and if a female, has not completed 18 years of age. Child marriage means a marriage or a marriage about to be solemnized, to which either of the parties is a child. The act not just prevents the marriage of children but also punishes the involved adults.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Causes of early marriage</strong></h2>



<p>Though stringent laws have been put in place, early marriage remains prevalent across the country, especially in rural and economically disadvantaged areas. It has always been driven by a combination of social, economic, and cultural factors. One of the foremost reasons for early marriage is that it is seen as a duty of parents.</p>



<p>Even today, in several conservative communities, marriage is often seen as a responsibility or obligation of parents, and it has never been the choice of women. Parents and extended family members force girls to marry at an early age to complete their responsibility. Not just that, the girls are also expected to fulfill their role in ensuring lineage and contributing to the family’s social status. Parents of girls who remain unmarried after a certain age face social stigma, and the girls feel like a burden on their families. To avoid the perceived shame, many families marry off their daughters at an early age.</p>



<p>Even modern communities see marriage as a way to preserve a family’s honour and reputation. It is due to the underlying belief that a girl’s worth is tied to her chastity and her role as a caregiver. Early marriages are often seen as a way to preserve their ‘purity’ and to avoid dishonour.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Impact of early marriage on young girls</strong></h2>



<p>Early marriage, one of the serious violations of children’s rights, has devastating consequences for both males and females. But, according to statistics, the number of girls who undergo early marriage is at least five times higher than their counterparts. About 250 million girls are married before the age of 13 across the globe. Research has also found that early marriages have affected them physically, emotionally, socially, and economically.</p>



<p><strong>1.&nbsp;<a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1410" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Health</a> risk:</strong> Early marriages often lead to girls becoming involved in physical intimacy before they are physically and emotionally ready. Chances are high that they know nothing about their sexual and reproductive health. That’s why child marriages often result in adolescent pregnancy with increased complications. Risks like premature labour, obstructed labour and eclampsia are commonly found in adolescent pregnancies. Girls also experience maternal mortality or childbirth-related injuries. They are also at greater risk of having babies with low birth weight, premature birth, or other health problems. This will put both the girl and her child in danger. Not just that, early marriages also increase the risk of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) as they are unaware of protecting themselves in sexual relationships.</p>



<p><strong>2.&nbsp;Interrupted <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2408" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a>:</strong> Girls are often taken out of school to marry off shortly after they hit puberty. Some societies restrict girls’ roles to being wives and mothers. Without education, they miss out on a crucial stage of development and self-discovery that typically defines their childhood and adolescence. They also miss out on opportunities to improve their economic autonomy and personal development. In most cases, they end up taking low-paying jobs or become dependent on their husbands for financial support. This economic dependence will lead to an unequal power dynamic in the marriage. It in turn will entrench gender inequality and limit a girl’s ability to make independent decisions.</p>



<p><strong>3.&nbsp;Social isolation:</strong> When a girl marries at a young age, her focus shifts to her new responsibilities as a wife, and later a mother. In many cases, they are confined to their new home and fulfill domestic duties. She will have little freedom to interact with her friends or extended family. Not just that, she will also not be allowed to participate in any social events or gatherings. There are numerous instances when a girl had to take permission from her husband or in-law to do literally anything. This lack of autonomy limits her opportunities to build and maintain healthy social connections. This social isolation can make her feel lonely and disconnected from her peers.</p>



<p><strong>4.&nbsp;Loss of childhood:</strong> Marriage always brings with it the expectation that girls will take on adult responsibilities. It means she will have to manage the household, cooking, cleaning, and caring for her in-laws, husband, and other family members. These duties not only take priority over her personal interests, play, and leisure, which are essential aspects of childhood, but also toil her emotionally. This emotional toil often makes them feel overwhelmed, confused, and isolated. This in turn will take away their carefree and joyful experiences that define childhood. Emotional stress and a stunted sense of self will end up interrupting developmental milestones of adolescence.</p>



<p><strong>5.&nbsp;Loss of identity:</strong> With the robbed education, she also loses the space for personal growth, critical thinking, and the exploration of interests and talents. This in turn deprives the girls of the chance to develop into independent individuals with their own aspirations. With this, they also lack the ability to make decisions about their own lives. Their choices regarding education, career, hobbies, and even personal relationships are often dictated by their husbands or families. In most cases, they will have none. This loss of autonomy will rob the control of their own futures from their hands. There are several cases when girls are subjected to domestic violence, sexual abuse, and exploitation in child marriages.</p>
