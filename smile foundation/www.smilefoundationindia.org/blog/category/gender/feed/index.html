While policies and progress sound great on paper, the reality on the ground tells a different story — one where access to healthcare, financial tools and basic opportunities is still a daily struggle. But there’s hope. Through government schemes and Smile Foundation’s Swabhiman programme, women are getting the support they need to lead fuller, healthier lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a rapidly advancing economy, one critical question demands attention: where do rural Indian women stand today? With nearly 48% of women still residing in rural areas, their progress remains central to the nation’s broader development. As technology and financial reforms reshape India’s economic landscape, the concern persists — are rural women advancing alongside the rest of the country, or are they being left behind?</p>



<p>India has made notable jump through legal reforms, government schemes, corporate collaborations and grassroots NGO efforts that aim to empower women. These initiatives have contributed to safer, more supportive environments for rural women. However, substantial challenges remain. Many rural areas continue to lack the infrastructure, resources and opportunities necessary for inclusive and equitable growth. Among the most urgent concerns are persistent <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2657" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> vulnerabilities and financial exclusion, both of which hinder the full participation of rural women in India&#8217;s development journey.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-her-health-vulnerabilities"><strong>Her Health Vulnerabilities</strong></h2>



<p>Women in rural India face ongoing health challenges, especially in maternal and reproductive care. Limited access to quality healthcare, preventive screenings and proper nutrition compounds their vulnerability. In Jharkhand, for instance, the Food, Nutrition, Health and WASH programme mobilised <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/health-hygiene-prog-expands-to-263-blocks/articleshow/122865171.cms" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">3.2 million women</a> through self-help groups (SHGs) to promote hygiene and health underscoring the scale of unmet need.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S187758452400011X" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5)</a> reports that over 57% of rural women aged 15–49 are anaemic, revealing a serious public health burden. Maternal mortality remains a critical issue, with India recording a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) of 97 per 100,000 live births (2018–2020), disproportionately affecting rural regions. At the same time, the rise of non-communicable diseases such as hypertension and diabetes poses growing risks to the long-term well-being of women.</p>



<p>Without adequate protection mechanisms, women often delay seeking care due to cost, distance or lack of awareness. This leads to preventable health shocks and higher maternal mortality, further weakening household resilience and relegating women&#8217;s health needs to secondary status.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-her-financial-vulnerabilities"><strong>Her Financial Vulnerabilities</strong></h2>



<p>Despite the growth of entrepreneurship initiatives targeting rural women, financial exclusion continues to undermine their economic agency. According to a 2023 NITI Aayog report, just 14% of Indian women are engaged in entrepreneurial activity, with even fewer represented in the formal sector. Structural barriers persist, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Limited access to institutional credit</li>



<li>Inadequate digital infrastructure</li>



<li>Absence of gender-responsive support systems</li>



<li>Social norms that limit decision-making and ownership</li>
</ul>



<p>While women now hold <a href="https://bfsi.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/banking/women-own-39-2-of-bank-accounts-in-india-42-2-in-rural-areas-government-report/120057614" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">42.2% of rural bank accounts</a>, they still face difficulties accessing credit, savings products and digital financial tools. Encouragingly, the number of women borrowers has tripled since 2019, with 60% from rural and semi-urban areas. (<em>From Borrowers to Builders: Women’s Role in India’s Financial Growth Story</em>)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-systemic-barriers-hindering-her-overall-growth"><strong>Systemic barriers hindering her overall growth</strong></h2>



<p>Beyond financial and health-related challenges, rural women face systemic barriers at the institutional and community levels, where adequate support is often lacking.</p>



<p>Cumbersome, bureaucratic loan processes laden with documentation and procedural delays discourage many from pursuing opportunities.<br>The absence of structured mentorship and peer support leaves aspiring entrepreneurs without networks to scale and sustain their businesses.<br>Gender bias and entrenched stereotypes within financial institutions and community settings continue to question women&#8217;s credibility and leadership potential.</p>



<p>Overcoming these barriers is essential to realising the full potential of rural women. The way forward must involve making social protection accessible to every woman, particularly those in India’s most remote and underserved regions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-social-protection-for-women-of-rural-communities"><strong>Understanding social protection for women of rural communities </strong></h3>



<p>To meaningfully include rural women under the social protection umbrella, we must begin with a clear definition. The International Labour Organisation defines social protection as the <a href="https://www.ilo.org/topics-and-sectors/social-protection" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">provision of social security</a> in response to life risks such as unemployment, disability and maternity as well as support for those experiencing poverty or social exclusion.</p>



<p>This definition reveals that poverty and exclusion disproportionately impact women in rural areas. Globally, over two billion women and girls lack access to any form of social protection. In India, this gap is equally concerning. Even where social protection mechanisms are in place, gender disparities persist. According to UN data, <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2024/10/world-survey-on-the-role-of-women-in-development-2024" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">only 50.1% of women</a> access at least one social protection benefit compared to 54.6% of men. Rural women face the highest levels of exclusion.</p>



<p>These figures highlight the urgency of developing a robust, gender-responsive social protection framework — one that not only extends coverage but also propels rural women forward in their journey toward empowerment and economic inclusion.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-government-initiatives-supporting-rural-women"><strong>Government initiatives supporting rural women</strong></h3>



<p>To advance women’s empowerment across rural India, the government has implemented several strategic programmes. Some of the most impactful include:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM)</strong><br>NRLM strengthens women’s self-help groups, expands credit access and promotes entrepreneurship building sustainable livelihoods and community resilience.</li>



<li><strong>MGNREGA</strong><br>With one-third of its jobs reserved for women, MGNREGA ensures fair wages, income security and economic independence.</li>



<li><strong>e-NAM and Cooperatives (NCDC)</strong><br>By facilitating market linkages and collective bargaining, women gain access to fair pricing and new opportunities in agriculture, dairy and textiles.</li>



<li><strong>Mission Poshan 2.0 and PMMVY</strong><br>These initiatives promote maternal nutrition and provide direct cash transfers, addressing critical vulnerabilities during pregnancy and early motherhood.</li>



<li><strong>Swachh Bharat, Ujjwala, and Jal Jeevan Missions</strong><br>Access to sanitation, clean water, and LPG connections improves health outcomes, reduces domestic drudgery and frees up time for <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2656" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> and employment.</li>



<li><strong>Digital Literacy and Mission Shakti</strong><br>Through digital training and safety initiatives, these programmes enhance women’s access to information, services and institutional support.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-swabhiman-a-grassroots-pillar-of-social-protection"><strong>Swabhiman – A grassroots pillar of social protection</strong></h3>



<p>While government policies set the groundwork, the true test of social protection lies in last-mile delivery ensuring access to health, nutrition and financial tools at the doorstep. Smile Foundation&#8217;s <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/women-empowerment/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Swabhiman</a></strong> programme plays a vital role in bridging this delivery gap, offering targeted support to rural women across multiple dimensions of empowerment.</p>



<p>In FY 2024, Swabhiman reached over 190,000 women across six states, equipping them with access to healthcare, financial literacy and entrepreneurial skills. The programme recognises that sustainable workforce participation is intricately tied to health, dignity and opportunity.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-partnering-for-women-s-empowerment-and-social-protection"><strong>Partnering for women’s empowerment and social protection</strong></h4>



<p>Rural women in India are resilient and ready to lead. Yet their advancement depends on equitable systems — ones that guarantee access to health services, financial resources and sustained opportunities.</p>



<p>Smile Foundation’s Swabhiman initiative provides a credible platform for corporates and civil society to partner with government efforts. By integrating healthcare, vocational training and financial and digital literacy, Swabhiman helps build long-term, community-rooted pathways for empowerment.</p>



<p>Together, we can ensure that social protection reaches the last mile and that every woman, no matter where she lives, has the opportunity to thrive.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a low-income neighbourhood of rural Haryana, Shyama adjusts the thread on her new sewing machine. When her husband lost work during the pandemic, she struggled to feed her three children. A local NGO’s counsellor taught her basic health and financial skills, then gave her a used sewing machine. Today Shyama makes clothes and even cloth masks, declaring “I have got back on my feet again”. Her story – a woman transforming adversity into opportunity – reflects the broader tide of change sweeping India. Across the country, millions of girls are finishing school and joining the workforce, and millions of women are starting tiny businesses and taking seats in village councils.</p>



<p>However, this progress has been neither uniform nor complete. Deep-rooted patriarchy, poverty, and illiteracy still hobble many lives. The facts bear this out. According to UNESCO, India’s female literacy in 2022 was only 70.3% (versus 84.7% for men), an improvement from a decade ago but still below the global female average (79%). Around 23 million Indian girls drop out of school when they begin menstruating, due to lack of sanitation and privacy in rural schools. One analysis warns that nearly one-third of young women still marry before 18, a practice unchanged from a decade ago.</p>



<p>At the same time, sweeping policies and grassroots programmes have ignited change. Government campaigns like <strong>Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao</strong> (2015) and expansions of the Right-to-Education guarantee have helped normalise schooling for girls. An academic review notes that “more girls are going to school because of the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao campaign,” and in many areas the gross enrolment ratio of girls has caught up with or even surpassed that of boys. </p>



<p>The midday-meal scheme and scholarships for higher secondary girls have further encouraged families to educate daughters. Still, dropout and disparity remain stubborn. UNESCO reports that of India’s 77.7% literacy rate in 2022, <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/why-educating-women-more-important-we-realize#:~:text=As%20per%20National%20Survey%20of,%28as%20per%20UNESCO" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">only 70.3% of women were literate</a>, leaving tens of millions of rural women still unable to read or write.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-education-opening-doors-changing-minds"><strong>Education: Opening doors, changing minds</strong></h2>



<p>Over the past two decades, India has invested heavily in girls’ schooling. New classrooms and teachers have sprouted in even remote villages, and laws now mandate free <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2643" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> up to age 14. These changes show in the numbers. For example, the National Family <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2642" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Health</a> Survey (2019–21) found that the share of women completing more than ten years of schooling has risen by over 5 percentage points from 2015. In some districts, girls outperform boys. Literacy rates in several Indian states now exceed those of males, especially at the primary level.</p>



<p>Government campaigns play a key role. <strong>Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao</strong> was launched to reverse sex-selection and promote girl-child education. Its soft-power message has had impact. Studies show that in areas where the programme ran, parents report greater willingness to send daughters to school. </p>



<p>The introduction of <strong>Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas</strong> in backward areas provides safe boarding schools for marginalised girls, and state initiatives like Haryana’s <strong>Ladli </strong>scholarships pay families to keep daughters in school. Even cultural barriers have begun to shift. NGOs and governments now distribute sanitary pads and build school toilets so that girls need not skip class each month.</p>



<p>But numbers tell a mixed story. Although enrolment rates for girls are climbing, millions of girls still miss class. A UNICEF-CRY report notes that globally 129 million girls are out of school and India accounts for a significant share. Teenage pregnancy and child marriage remain major drop-out factors. According to NFHS-5, nearly <a href="https://idronline.org/what-does-nfhs-5-data-tell-us-about-women-empowerment-in-india/#:~:text=,to%20have%20worsened%20these%20trends" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">30% of Indian women were married before 18</a>, a figure barely changed from the previous survey in 2015. And only about <a href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2113800#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Institutional%20births%20have%20increased,in%20eighteen%20other%20States%2FUTs" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">90% of births now occur in institutions</a> – a sign that many rural women still lack access to full antenatal education or may be denied maternal care due to family preferences.</p>



<p>The education story is also one of aspiration. Data from rural India suggest that when women’s literacy rises, daughters’ schooling improves too. <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2023/09/indias-new-gender-quota-law-is-a-win-for-womenmostly?lang=en#:~:text=they%20can%20deliver%20tangible%20governance,increased%20reporting%20of%20crimes%20against" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Research</a> on village council quotas shows that electing women leaders increased girls’ aspirations and educational attainment in those communities. </p>



<p>In one Punjab village, after a female sarpanch was elected, parents let daughters attend higher schooling for the first time. Similarly, female role models – India’s first woman president Droupadi Murmu (herself the first female graduate of her tribal village) or scientists like C.V. Raman’s daughter Anita – are now visible examples.</p>



<p>Behind these big trends are individual stories. Rinki, a young mother in Uttar Pradesh, married at 16 and had twins, yet returned to school via a distance-teaching programme and became a village teacher (her story circulated on NGO blogs). Nidhi, in Bihar, grew up with a teacher-father but lost him early; a local NGO recruited her to persuade families to send girls to school, and she even helped prevent three child marriages through grassroots outreach. These on-the-ground efforts embody the idea that education empowers women to break cycles of poverty.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-policies-aim-to-sustain-this-progress"><strong>New policies aim to sustain this progress</strong></h3>



<p>The 2020 National Education Policy promises universal foundational literacy, and explicitly emphasises girls’ education. Financial incentives like the <strong>Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana</strong> (which lets parents save in a special bank account for a girl child) and conditional cash transfers in some states reward families for keeping girls in school. Digital initiatives like free Wi-Fi at schools and smart classrooms have also reached rural areas. (However, the digital divide poses a barrier: <a href="https://www.iipsindia.ac.in/sites/default/files/The_digital_divide_and_is_it_holding_back_women_in_India_Hindustan_Times.pdf#:~:text=stark.%20National%20Family%20Health%20Survey,of%20men" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">only about 33% of women in India</a> even use the Internet, so e-learning must still overcome gender gaps in access.)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-entrepreneurship-and-economic-independence-for-women-empowerment"><strong>Entrepreneurship and economic independence for women empowerment</strong></h2>



<p>For women in India, financial independence is a crucial step toward empowerment. In recent years the economy has begun to open new doors. Microcredit and self-help groups (SHGs) have spread widely. The National Rural Livelihood Mission has organised over 100 million rural women into roughly <a href="https://government.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/day-nrlm-mobilised-over-10-04-crore-women-into-90-76-lakh-self-help-groups-charanjit-singh/111689012#:~:text=Singh%20informed%20that%20DAY,NRLM" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">9 million SHG</a>s by 2024. These groups pool savings and give tiny loans for small businesses – sari-weaving, goat-rearing, tailoring – activities traditionally done by women. Government-led Rashtriya Mahila Kosh (Women’s Fund) has, by 2020, disbursed loans totaling ₹315 crores to dozens of rural institutions, reaching 741,000 women entrepreneurs.</p>



<p>More recently, national banking schemes have targeted female founders. The 2016 <strong>Stand-Up India</strong> scheme reserves lines of credit for SC/ST women entrepreneurs. Its growth has been dramatic. By late 2024 nearly <strong>191,000 women-led accounts</strong> were opened, with some ₹43,984 crore sanctioned to women borrowers – up from only ~55,000 women’s accounts and ₹12,452 crore in 2018. These loans are used for enterprises big and small: a bakery in Punjab, a dairy in Tamil Nadu, a tech startup in Delhi. NBFCs and microfinance outfits also cater largely to women; for example, Mann Deshi Bank in Maharashtra lends mostly to village women, leading them to invest in farms or shops.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, outside the formal sector, a new entrepreneurial spirit is evident. In Bangalore, Yashoda (a mother of two) saw her cab-driver husband’s income vanish during the COVID lockdown. She joined Smile Foundation’s Entrepreneurship Development programme, where women learn skills like budgeting and marketing. With other trainees she launched a handmade cosmetics brand called <strong>Kadamba Naturals.</strong> By 2023 that cooperative of 15 women was selling herbal soaps online, each earning an extra ₹5,000–10,000 per month from home. Her story illustrates a wider fact. When women earn, they often plow profits into their families. Social enterprises like Okhai (a Gujarat-based NGO) have replicated this model: by training ~30,000 tribal women in embroidery crafts, Okhai helped many artisans roughly double their incomes to a few thousand rupees a month.</p>



<p>Government programmes support such grassroots efforts for <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/women-empowerment/" title="Women Empowerment" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2641" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">women empowerment</a> in India. In addition to loans, schemes like <strong>Mahila-e-Haat</strong> (an online marketplace for women’s products) and state-sponsored startup grants have appeared. State projects like Kerala’s Kudumbashree (one of the world’s largest women’s SHG networks) link literacy with <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" title="Livelihood" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2644" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">livelihood</a>: they run microenterprises from canteens to coir mats. </p>



<p>Under <strong>Skill India</strong>, thousands of young women have taken vocational courses in IT, healthcare or hospitality. However, despite all this, data suggest the economic inclusion of women remains low. Only 28% of ever-married women report paid work, down from 30% in 2005 – a stubborn stagnation even as more girls attend college. Many educated women still cite household responsibilities or lack of suitable jobs as barriers. In cities, women’s labour-force participation is only around 20% (compared to 50%+ for men), according to World Bank estimates.</p>



<p>Social norms often restrict women’s work outside the home and field jobs (agriculture, mining) remain male-dominated. When women do start businesses, they face hurdles in securing land, patents, or market access. Crime and harassment can deter traders in the evening markets. Digital platforms help some – smartphone apps allow women to sell handicrafts or produce online – but the digital divide is real. Rural women are half as likely as men to have used the internet, limiting their access to e-commerce.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-little-ventures-are-gaining-visibility"><strong>Little ventures are gaining visibility</strong></h3>



<p>Women-run startups (often in food, textiles, or edtech) have begun attracting funding. Bengaluru’s <strong>She Taxi</strong> and Pune’s <strong>She Bus</strong> projects offer women drivers and conductors. Some tech incubators now specifically support women entrepreneurs. And credit bureaus now report better repayment by women borrowers, encouraging banks to lend more to them. The wage gap, though still large, has slightly narrowed in some sectors. As one GDP study points out, these initiatives are markers of women empowerment and economically could add an estimated $770 billion to India’s GDP by 2025 if all girls were educated and participating in the workforce.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-women-empowerment-starts-with-health-nutrition-and-body-autonomy"><strong>Women empowerment starts with health, nutrition, and body autonomy</strong></h2>



<p>Women’s empowerment also depends on health and control over their own bodies. India has made impressive gains. Maternal mortality has fallen from 130 per 100,000 births in 2014–16 to 97 by 2018–20, hitting the National Health Policy target ahead of schedule. Institutional deliveries have climbed from 79% to 89% of births, thanks to cash incentives (Janani Suraksha Yojana) and free ambulance programmes. The proportion of pregnant women receiving four or more antenatal visits rose from 51% to 59%. Nearly all states now boast >90% hospital births, and even rural areas are at ~87%. These strides reflect intensified investments under the National Health Mission (RMNCH+A) and nutrition drives (like ICDS and Poshan Abhiyaan). In 2025, eight Indian states have achieved the UN goal of maternal mortality below 70, and the national average is on track to hit 70 by 2030.</p>



<p>Nutrition and livelihood often overlap. In tribal Maharashtra, Ishwati (a widow with four children) struggled to feed her family on day-wages. With a small grant from Smile Foundation, she began cultivating vegetables on a plot behind her hut. Soon she organised neighbours into an SHG to expand the garden. “We used to go hungry in lockdown, now we eat greens every day,” she says. Her story highlights the link between health and empowerment. Access to nutrient-rich food, cooking fuel, and clean water is a basic right, and women are usually at the forefront of ensuring family nutrition. NGOs like Smile’s <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/donation/women-empowerment" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Swabhiman</a> </strong>programme address these needs holistically alongside vocational training, we run health camps and nutrition education for women. For example, Swabhiman reports having sensitised over 76,000 women on reproductive and child health issues in 2023–24.</p>

<p>Government schemes also target women’s health. In addition to the maternity programmes above, the Pradhan Mantri Matritva Vandana Yojana (a cash support for pregnant women) has been scaled up, and the Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram offers free delivery and newborn care. Menstrual hygiene is finally getting attention. National campaigns now distribute low-cost sanitary pads and build school toilets (still, almost a quarter of adolescent girls lack safe menstrual products in rural areas). Family planning services have expanded, though nearly 60% of contraception users still rely on female sterilisation rather than shared responsibility. </p>



<p>Importantly, legal rights have strengthened. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act was amended in 2021 to allow abortions on demand up to 24 weeks for most women – a victory for reproductive autonomy (though safe services and awareness gaps remain).</p>



<p>However, public health faces big challenges. Malnutrition still affects over 30% of under-five children (with mothers’ nutrition a key factor), and anemia in women remains pervasive. Gender-based violence is tragically common. Surveys find that around one in three married women have experienced spousal violence. While laws like the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (2005) exist, enforcement and social stigma often lag. Maternal mental health is also under-addressed – many mothers face depression without support. The COVID-19 pandemic strained services and education (school closures set back young girls’ learning).</p>



<p>On the upside, recent years have seen more women in health professions and leadership. Women now make up a growing share of medical and nursing students. High-profile female doctors and health activists (such as K. Sujata or Rujuta Diwekar) have raised women’s health issues in public discourse. State governments are appointing female health officers in remote areas to improve trust with villagers. Access to digital technology holds promise like telemedicine and health apps could reach homes and youth, if the gender digital gap can be narrowed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-politics-and-public-power"><strong>Politics and public power</strong></h2>



<p>Women empowerment is incomplete without political voice. Here too India has made structural reforms. In rural and urban local government, women’s representation has leapt. Since the 1990s one-third of all panchayat (village council) seats have been reserved for women, rotating each election. As a result, nearly 1.3 million of India’s 3.1 million local elected officials are women. Those female sarpanches have been found to spend more on water and education, and to change attitudes – research shows that girls in villages with reserved female leaders have higher educational aspirations. Many states (e.g. Bihar, Maharashtra, Jharkhand) even increased the quota to 50%.</p>



<p>At the state and national level, change has been slower but is stirring. Women currently hold only about 15% of seats in the Lok Sabha and 14% in the Rajya Sabha. In September 2023, Parliament passed a long-delayed law reserving one-third of seats in the Lok Sabha and in state assemblies for women. (Implementation awaits the next delimitation exercise, so the actual increase may only come by the early 2030s.) The new “Women’s Reservation Act” was hailed as historic, although debate continues over whether quotas alone can uproot patriarchal norms.</p>



<p>Women have also emerged as governors of major parties and states. The 2024 general election saw several women in top candidacy lists (PM Narendra Modi’s BJP fielded a record number), and for the first time, women voted in almost equal numbers to men. Figures like Mamata Banerjee, J. Jayalalithaa (deceased) and Mayawati have shown women can be powerful chief ministers; and for years Indira Gandhi and now Nirmala Sitharaman have been major national figures. But critics note that dynastic politics and male-dominated party hierarchies often limit genuine female leadership.</p>



<p>Civil society has played a vital role too. Groups like the Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) and Mahila Samakhya (rural education) empower women to lobby for their rights. The national and state election commissions train “women voter camps” to encourage female turnout. On the streets, women’s movements (from protests against sexual violence to campaigns for inheritance rights) have kept pressure on elites. Media and social media are amplifying women’s voices on issues from menstrual equity (the viral #Padwoman campaign) to street safety (the Delhi “Pink Auto” women-run cabs).</p>



<p>Still, India’s political empowerment of women is incomplete. International indices underline this. The World Economic Forum’s 2025 Gender Gap Report ranks India <strong>131th out of 148 countries</strong>. It notes that while parity in educational attainment has nearly been achieved, economic participation and political empowerment lag far behind. In practice, women are underrepresented in senior bureaucracy, and their policy concerns (like domestic violence laws or maternity leave) often lack full political backing.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-challenges-and-the-road-ahead-for-women-empowerment-in-india"><strong>Challenges and the road ahead for women empowerment in India</strong></h2>



<p>India’s journey of empowerment is far from over. On one hand, the gains in education, health, entrepreneurship and local governance over the last 20–30 years are remarkable by historical standards. Millions of mothers like Shyama or entrepreneurs like Yashoda owe their new livelihoods to these trends. Girls who would have been kept at home now walk to class. Villages that never saw a female leader now elect women to run water pumps or gram sabhas.</p>



<p>Still many hurdles remain. The economy has not yet created enough jobs in areas where women can easily work. Social attitudes can change slowly. Surveys still find that a significant fraction of Indians (especially in patriarchal regions) believe a woman should tolerate some domestic violence or must get her husband’s permission to work. Caste and religion add layers of complexity. Dalit and minority women face additional discrimination, and their empowerment requires addressing social justice too.</p>



<p>Looking forward, experts urge a multi-pronged push. Literacy and skill-building must continue: implementing the new education policy fully, expanding vocational training in rural India, and closing the digital gender gap (only about one in four rural women are online). Health programmes need more funding. India’s female life expectancy still trails many countries, and mental health services for women are weak. Economists note that if India could close the gender gap in employment, women’s labour-force share could rise dramatically – a key to achieving the government’s goal of a $5-trillion economy by 2030.</p>



<p>Politically, the women’s reservation law could be a game-changer once implemented, but it will take years to translate into more policies for women unless accompanied by capacity-building and public support. Civil society and media will continue to play watchdog roles, as will international norms and the SDGs. On the streets, daily challenges like workplace harassment, safety in public, and family pressures are battles still being fought by each generation.</p>



<p>In sum, India’s women’s empowerment is a long arc with many actors: governments at all levels, NGOs like Smile Foundation, grassroots leaders, families and the women themselves. Their progress has been uneven and contested, but unmistakable. As one scholar notes, making women part of the growth story is not only a matter of justice but of national survival. The work continues – from Haryana’s looms to Delhi’s parliament – weaving an Indian society ever more inclusive of its women.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Violence against women remains one of the most persistent violations of human rights globally. While laws, campaigns, and justice mechanisms play a role, the deeper and more enduring antidote lies in empowerment. Women’s empowerment is not simply a social good; it is a structural and economic necessity for building equitable, peaceful societies. Empowered women are more likely to assert their rights, challenge harmful social norms, and demand accountability when institutions fail them.</p>



<p>In India, where gender-based violence (GBV) intersects with structural inequality, poverty, and patriarchal norms, women’s empowerment plays a pivotal role in both preventing violence and enabling survivors to reclaim agency. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-gender-based-violence-in-india"><strong>Understanding gender-based violence in India</strong></h2>



<p>Gender-based violence is not confined to physical abuse. It encompasses a wide range of harms, including institutional violence (by state and legal systems), emotional and psychological abuse, sexual exploitation, and discrimination within households and communities. While GBV can affect all genders, women and girls are disproportionately affected due to entrenched gender hierarchies.</p>



<p>According to the <strong>National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB)</strong>, reported crimes against women in India rose by <a href="https://frontline.thehindu.com/news/crime-in-india-2022-ncrb-report-over-445000-crimes-against-women-in-2022-one-every-51-minutes-murders-juvenile-crimes-uapa-offences-against-state-uttar-pradesh-delhi-kolkata-kerala/article67607146.ece" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">12.9% between 2018 and 2022</a>, from 58.8 to 66.4 incidents per 100,000 women. Although this may partly reflect improved reporting, it underscores the urgent need to address GBV through comprehensive, preventative approaches.</p>

<p>Globally, UN Women estimates that one in three women has experienced physical or sexual violence, typically by intimate partners. These rates increase significantly in crisis contexts such as displacement, conflict, or pandemics, where legal protections weaken and vulnerability rises.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-education-the-first-step-toward-prevention"><strong>Education: The first step toward prevention</strong></h2>



<p><a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2518" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Education</a> is a foundational intervention in reducing GBV. When girls remain in school longer, the incidence of child marriage, early pregnancy, and domestic violence decreases.

<p>Educated women are more likely to delay marriage, negotiate safer relationships, and resist societal pressure that normalizes violence. Moreover, education increases employment opportunities and financial independence, key factors in reducing vulnerability to abusive relationships.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="679" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-4-1024x679.png" alt="" class="wp-image-13903" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-4-1024x679.png 1024w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-4-300x199.png 300w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-4-768x509.png 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-4-1536x1018.png 1536w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-4-1200x796.png 1200w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-4.png 1780w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Insight:</strong> Primary completion rose from <strong>76% to 91%</strong>, while secondary completion saw major progress—from <strong>38% in 2005</strong> to <strong>66% in 2021</strong>, indicating strong gains in girls’ education.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-economic-empowerment-from-dependence-to-autonomy"><strong>Economic empowerment: From dependence to autonomy</strong></h2>



<p>Economic dependence is a significant barrier to leaving abusive relationships. When women have access to work, credit, financial literacy, and entrepreneurship, they gain the capacity to make independent decisions about their lives and well-being. Financial inclusion empowers women to leave violent situations and seek legal or psychosocial support when needed.</p>



<p>The evolution of financial access in India is notable. The 2011 Census revealed only 58.7% of households had access to banking services. By 2016, this had risen to 99%, according to ICE 360°. Targeting women for financial inclusion has cascading effects—studies show that women invest a larger share of their income in education, nutrition, and healthcare, amplifying household well-being.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="727" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-1-1024x727.png" alt="" class="wp-image-13900" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-1-1024x727.png 1024w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-1-300x213.png 300w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-1-768x545.png 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-1-1200x852.png 1200w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-1.png 1380w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Insight:</strong> Household access to banking rose from <strong>58.7% in 2011</strong> to <strong>99% in 2016</strong>, illustrating the massive leap in financial inclusion, especially relevant to women&#8217;s economic empowerment.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Cash transfers have also been shown to reduce GBV by easing financial strain and enabling women to make autonomous decisions. When embedded in social protection frameworks, direct benefits can shift power dynamics within households and increase women’s mobility and access to support services.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-addressing-social-norms-transforming-relationships-and-power"><strong>Addressing social norms: Transforming relationships and power</strong></h2>



<p>Empowerment requires challenging and transforming harmful social norms that legitimise violence. Feminist frameworks advocate for rebalancing power within families and communities, promoting shared decision-making and consent-based relationships.</p>



<p>This shift begins with community-level education that targets boys and men as allies in gender equality. Since men are often the primary perpetrators of GBV, interventions must focus on redefining masculinity, challenging entitlement-based behaviours, and cultivating respect for women’s autonomy.</p>



<p>Creating safe spaces, such as women’s centres, helplines, or peer networks, offers survivors the confidentiality and support they need to report violence and recover from trauma. These spaces also serve as platforms for advocacy, legal assistance, and skill-building.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-role-of-women-led-and-community-based-organisations-in-reducing-gender-based-violence"><strong>The role of women-led and community-based organisations in reducing gender-based violence</strong></h2>



<p>Local women’s organisations are among the most effective actors in reducing GBV. They are embedded within communities, deeply attuned to local contexts, and trusted by the populations they serve. Their work ranges from operating shelters and helplines to leading campaigns and training programs.</p>



<p>Such organisations also play a crucial role in responding to the intersectionality of violence—where gender, caste, class, religion, and disability combine to create multiple layers of marginalisation. For example, dalit women often face both caste-based and gendered violence, requiring interventions that address both hierarchies.</p>



<p>Supporting these organisations with funding, capacity-building, and institutional recognition ensures that GBV prevention efforts are not top-down but inclusive, participatory, and sustainable.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-case-in-point-smile-foundation-s-integrated-approach"><strong>Case in point: Smile Foundation’s integrated approach</strong></h2>



<p>Smile Foundation exemplifies how integrated, community-based approaches to women’s empowerment can reduce gender-based violence. Since 2005, its <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/women-empowerment/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Swabhiman</a></strong> programme has worked to equip women with healthcare access, educational support, and leadership opportunities.</p>



<p>Swabhiman operates on a 4S model:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Seeking healthcare as a behaviour</strong></li>



<li><strong>Support through education</strong></li>



<li><strong>Support from men and male allies</strong></li>



<li><strong>Sustaining change through community engagement</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>To date, the initiative has reached over <strong>150,000 women and girls</strong>, with more than <strong>1,000 trained as community change agents</strong> advocating for rights, equity, and dignity.</p>



<p>In addition, through <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/smile-foundations-project-manzil-inspires-young-girls-to-seek-aspiring-careers-with-21st-century-employability-skills-2/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Project Manzil</a></strong>, Smile Foundation has enhanced vocational education for girls in Grades 9–12 across six districts in Rajasthan by installing smart TVs and delivering audio-visual training. Over <strong>13,000 girls</strong> have benefitted from this digital learning initiative, while more than <strong>14,000 girls</strong> have received employability training and <strong>5,000</strong> have accessed on-the-job placements.</p>

<p>These initiatives foster confidence, resilience, and social mobility, enabling young women to challenge the status quo and advocate for safer, more equitable environments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-addressing-structural-challenges"><strong>Addressing structural challenges</strong> </h2>



<p>While empowerment-based approaches offer hope, several systemic barriers must be addressed:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-patriarchal-social-structures"><strong>1. Patriarchal Social Structures</strong></h3>



<p>Gender norms that prioritise male authority and control must be dismantled through sustained education, media engagement, and community mobilisation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-underreporting-and-legal-obstacles"><strong>2. Underreporting and Legal Obstacles</strong></h3>



<p>Many women remain silent due to fear of retaliation, social stigma, or mistrust in the justice system. Strengthening survivor-centred reporting mechanisms and legal aid is essential.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-weak-implementation-of-laws"><strong>3. Weak Implementation of Laws</strong></h3>



<p>Despite progressive legal frameworks (e.g., the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act), poor enforcement, delays, and corruption hinder justice. Reforms must address not only laws but the ecosystem in which they are implemented.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-intersectionality-and-inclusion"><strong>4. Intersectionality and Inclusion</strong></h3>



<p>Policies must consider the layered discrimination faced by women from marginalised communities. One-size-fits-all interventions often fail those most in need.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-empowerment-as-prevention"><strong>Empowerment as prevention</strong></h2>



<p>Women’s empowerment is not merely a parallel goal to ending gender-based violence—it is the core strategy. Education, financial independence, safe spaces, legal access, and social capital collectively reduce women’s vulnerability and expand their capacity for self-determination.</p>



<p>NGOs demonstrate that empowerment must begin early, embed locally, and evolve with the needs of women. Policymakers, researchers, and civil society must recognise that eliminating GBV is about prevention, protection, and power redistribution.</p>



<p>As India and other nations chart pathways to gender equality, investments in women’s empowerment will determine whether progress is inclusive or superficial—whether freedom from violence becomes the norm or remains an elusive right.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Pregnancy and childbirth are often described as magical, life-changing experiences—and they are. But what comes after can be just as intense, just as transformative, and often, not talked about enough.</p>



<p>Once the baby arrives, attention naturally shifts to the newborn. But a mother’s journey is far from over. In fact, it&#8217;s just entering a new chapter. The postpartum period, those first weeks and months after delivery, is a time of physical healing, emotional recalibration, and massive change. And yet, many women feel completely unprepared for it.</p>



<p>Let’s talk about what really happens during postpartum, why it matters, and how more open, informed conversations can help women feel seen, supported, and better equipped to take care of themselves.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-physical-side-what-your-body-goes-through-after-birth"><strong>The physical side: What your body goes through after birth</strong></h2>



<p>No one really tells you how physically demanding postpartum recovery can be. Sure, childbirth is tough but what happens afterward can be equally intense.</p>



<p>For starters, your uterus doesn’t just shrink back immediately. It takes weeks to return to its normal size, and the contractions that help it get there can cause cramping that feels like strong period pain. This is completely normal but often catches women by surprise.</p>



<p>Then there&#8217;s <strong><a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/22485-lochia#:~:text=What%20is%20lochia%3F-,Lochia%20is%20the%20vaginal%20discharge%20you%20have%20after%20giving%20birth,flow%20until%20it%20goes%20away." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">lochia</a></strong>, a heavy vaginal discharge made up of blood and tissue, which can continue for up to six weeks. Many women aren’t prepared for the amount or duration of postpartum bleeding and that can be unsettling if they don’t know what to expect.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/labor-and-delivery/in-depth/postpartum-care/art-20047233" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Vaginal soreness</a></strong> is also common, especially for those who had a vaginal delivery. Swelling, discomfort in the perineal area, and stinging while urinating can linger for days or even weeks. Ice packs, warm baths, and prescribed pain relief can help, but the healing process is personal and varies greatly from woman to woman.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/5-common-breastfeeding-problems" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Breastfeeding</a> brings another set of challenges. Breasts can feel swollen, tender, or painfully engorged. Cracked nipples, latching issues, and early breastfeeding discomfort are more common than most admit. And while nursing is often portrayed as natural and bonding, it doesn’t always come easily. Many mothers find the process frustrating, even distressing.</p>



<p>On top of that, hormone fluctuations, interrupted sleep, and the sheer exhaustion of caring for a newborn can leave women drained, both physically and emotionally.</p>



<p>This is why postpartum <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2504" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> is so crucial. New mothers need to be informed about what’s normal, what’s not, and when to seek help. Unfortunately, in many parts of India, and especially in rural or underserved communities, this kind of information just isn’t readily available.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-closing-the-gap-making-postpartum-care-accessible"><strong>Closing the gap: Making postpartum care accessible</strong></h2>



<p>Healthcare providers are doing their best, but time, infrastructure, and access are often limited. That’s where non-profits step in to fill critical gaps.</p>



<p>Smile Foundation is working to change that narrative. Through our <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/donation/women-empowerment" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Swabhiman</a> </strong>programme, we conduct awareness sessions that empower women with information about postpartum health—from hygiene to nutrition to newborn care. These sessions not only educate but also encourage women to seek care without shame or delay.</p>



<p>In areas where clinics are few and far between, Smile Foundation’s <strong>Smile on Wheels</strong> initiative brings healthcare right to women’s doorsteps. These mobile medical units, staffed with doctors and paramedics, provide essential maternal and child <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2503" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> services, including check-ups, basic diagnostics, and medications—free of cost.</p>



<p>By reaching women who might otherwise fall through the cracks, these initiatives play a vital role in building a more equitable healthcare system and improving maternal outcomes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-emotional-wellness-the-part-we-don-t-talk-about-enough"><strong>Emotional Wellness: The part we don’t talk about enough</strong></h2>



<p>While the physical changes are more visible, the emotional toll of postpartum can be just as significant—if not more so. Yet it often goes unacknowledged.</p>



<p>Many new mothers experience the “baby blues” in the first few days after birth. These mood swings, tearfulness, and irritability are usually short-lived. But when feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or anxiety persist, it could be something more serious: <strong>Postpartum Depression (PPD)</strong>.</p>



<p>PPD affects between <strong>10 to 20 percent of women</strong> after childbirth. It’s not simply about feeling tired or overwhelmed. Women with PPD may experience emotional numbness, chronic fatigue, trouble bonding with their baby, sleep and appetite disturbances, and even thoughts of self-harm or harming their child.</p>



<p>PPD can begin a few weeks after delivery, or it might take months to show up. Either way, it&#8217;s real, it’s serious, and it’s treatable. What’s needed is early identification and support through therapy, medication when needed, or a combination of both.</p>



<p>Again, awareness plays a huge role here. Smile Foundation has also stepped up in this space, conducting outreach and educational programmes focused on maternal mental health, breastfeeding education, and nutritional care. These programmes are designed not just to inform but to empower women to recognise when they need help and to feel safe asking for it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-talking-about-postpartum-matters"><strong>Why talking about postpartum matters</strong></h2>



<p>The postpartum period is not just about recovery—it’s a time of rediscovery. A woman’s identity is reshaped as she learns to care for a newborn while also navigating pain, fatigue, hormonal shifts, and social expectations.</p>



<p>Yet, conversations about postpartum tend to be hushed or wrapped in guilt and pressure—to bounce back, to keep smiling, to just “be grateful.” The result? Many women feel isolated, overwhelmed, or even ashamed of their struggles.</p>



<p>Changing this starts with acknowledging the full picture. By speaking openly about the physical and emotional realities of postpartum, we make it easier for women to share, to seek support, and to trust that what they’re feeling is valid.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-support-should-be-commonplace-for-new-mothers"><strong>Support should be commonplace for new mothers</strong></h2>



<p>Postpartum care shouldn’t be a privilege. It should be a standard part of every mother’s healthcare journey. That means:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Providing clear, consistent information before and after delivery.</li>



<li>Offering mental health support without stigma.</li>



<li>Making maternal health services available and accessible, no matter where a woman lives.</li>



<li>Empowering women to ask questions and advocate for their own well-being.</li>
</ul>



<p>Motherhood is powerful, but it’s also vulnerable. And women shouldn’t have to navigate that vulnerability alone.</p>



<p>Let’s start telling the full story. Let’s listen to mothers. And let’s make sure every woman knows she’s not alone—because she isn’t.</p>

<p>We learnt everything from scratch how to run the machines, manage the accounts, and make it all work. The first time we earned from our own effort it brought tears to our eyes.</p>

<p>In many quiet corners of rural India, a silent revolution is taking shape. It isn’t loud, and it rarely makes headlines. But it&#8217;s built on the resilience of women who are rewriting the rules of enterprise from bee farms to rice mills and cloth factories. These are women who were never short on potential, only opportunity.</p>



<p>For too long, the narrative of rural <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/no-future-without-women-entrepreneurs/" title="No Future without Women Entrepreneurs" data-wpil-monitor-id="1960" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">women entrepreneurs in India</a> has been confined to subsistence livelihoods— informal, seasonal, and low-income.

<p>India has no shortage of skilled women. Yet, only 20% of businesses<em>*</em> in the country are led by women. And most of these are small, unregistered ventures with limited scope and scale. What holds them back isn’t ambition but systemic inaccessibility. A lack of training, <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/financial-literacy-among-rural-women/" title="Financial Literacy among Rural Women" data-wpil-monitor-id="1962" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">financial literacy</a>, mentorship, and formal support continues to shut women out of meaningful entrepreneurial opportunities.</p>



<p><strong>This is not just a gender issue— it’s an economic one.</strong></p>



<p>The untapped potential of women entrepreneurs represents a significant loss to local economies and national development goals.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-do-india-s-women-entrepreneurs-stand"><strong>Where do India’s women entrepreneurs stand?</strong></h2>



<p>According to a 2023 NITI Aayog report*, only 14% of Indian <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/celebrate-womens-day-2024-employee-engagement-activities/" title="Celebrate Women’s Day 2024: Employee Engagement Activities" data-wpil-monitor-id="1966" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">women are engaged in entrepreneurial activities</a> and even fewer in formal sectors. The barriers are steep:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Limited access to institutional credit<br></li>



<li>Inadequate digital infrastructure<br></li>



<li>Lack of gender-sensitive support systems<br></li>



<li>Social norms that restrict decision-making and ownership</li>
</ul>



<p>Despite multiple government schemes, the ground reality remains tough. Women know where they want to go— but the system often lacks the roadmaps to take them there.</p>

Despite growing awareness and policy efforts, women still face <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/07/female-entrepreneurs-india-success-despite-funding-gap/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">systemic barriers</a> on their entrepreneurial journey. From financial exclusion to socio-cultural biases<em>,</em> the challenges are complex and deeply entrenched. Understanding these challenges is essential to designing effective interventions. Below are some of the key structural and societal barriers faced by women entrepreneurs across India.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Limited accessibility to financial schemes</strong><strong><br></strong>Despite the presence of government and institutional financial schemes for women entrepreneurs, access remains a major hurdle. Women often lack the resources or networks to navigate the system effectively.<br></li>



<li><strong>Collateral and credit barriers</strong><strong><br></strong>Banks and financial institutions frequently require collateral, which many women do not possess or have legal ownership over. Creditworthiness is often questioned, reinforcing financial exclusion.<br></li>



<li><strong>Complex and bureaucratic processes</strong><strong><br></strong>Application procedures for loans and schemes are often lengthy, technical, and not user-friendly. Documentation and verification requirements often create extra barriers for first-time women entrepreneurs.<br></li>



<li><strong>Lack of structured mentorship</strong><strong><br></strong>Women entrepreneurs frequently operate without access to industry mentors, peer networks, or professional guidance. The absence of mentorship limits their ability to scale, innovate, or navigate regulatory frameworks.<br></li>



<li><strong>Inconsistent institutional and community support</strong><strong><br></strong>Support systems are fragmented across institutions, and the continuity of assistance is often uncertain and unreliable. Many schemes and interventions are short-term or lack proper follow-up mechanisms.<br></li>



<li><strong>Gender bias and societal stereotypes</strong><strong><br></strong>Gender bias manifests in financial institutions, corporate boardrooms, and local community interactions. Women often face scepticism or dismissal, undermining their business credibility and decision-making authority.<br></li>



<li><strong>Lack of real autonomy</strong><strong><br></strong>In many cases, women are listed as business owners on paper, while male family members retain operational control undermining genuine empowerment and limiting their entrepreneurial agency.<br></li>



<li><strong>Need for systemic redesign<br></strong>Addressing these challenges requires a shift from surface-level initiatives to structural reforms. Policies must be redesigned to ensure equitable <strong>access</strong>, <strong>inclusion</strong>, and <strong>sustained opportunity</strong> for women in entrepreneurship.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-strategic-interventions-for-women-entrepreneurs-in-india"><strong>Strategic interventions for women entrepreneurs in India</strong></h3>



<p>Behind every woman who dreams of starting her own business in India lies a complex web of challenges— but also a powerful potential waiting to be unlocked. While systemic barriers persist, thoughtfully designed and compassionately delivered strategic interventions can spark meaningful and lasting change.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-government-schemes-with-transformative-potential"><strong>1. Government schemes with transformative potential</strong></h4>



<p>Schemes like <strong>Stand-Up India</strong>, the <strong>Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP)</strong>, and the <strong>Mahila Samman Savings Certificate</strong> are policies that represent the promise of financial independence, dignity, and opportunity for millions of women.</p>



<p>But for many women, that promise remains just out of reach. The forms are lengthy, the steps confusing, the language bureaucratic. Picture a woman in a rural district, holding a printed government scheme in her hands with no one to help her navigate the maze.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-digital-and-financial-literacy-a-critical-lifeline"><strong>2. Digital and financial literacy: A critical lifeline</strong></h4>



<p>In today’s world, reading a bank statement, using a digital payment app, or filing a GST return online isn’t optional, it&#8217;s a necessity. But countless women entrepreneurs still lack access to these basic tools. Many are forced to rely on others—often men—for financial transactions, leaving them vulnerable and dependent.</p>



<p>Equipping women with <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/women-empowerment/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow"><strong>digital and financial literacy</strong></a> is about restoring that lost control. When a woman can manage her money, track her income, or apply for a loan from her phone, she doesn’t just grow a business— she reclaims control over her life.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-csr-ngo-partnerships-bridging-policy-and-practice"><strong>3. CSR–NGO partnerships: Bridging policy and practice</strong></h4>



<p>At the grassroots level, <strong>CSR–NGO partnerships</strong> play a unique and irreplaceable role. These organisations are often the only ones walking shoulder-to-shoulder with women, village to village, family to family helping them navigate loan applications, understand government schemes, and <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/development-organisations-and-building-sustainable-futures/" title="Development Organisations and Building Sustainable Futures" data-wpil-monitor-id="1963" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">build the self-belief that sustains</a> entrepreneurship.</p>



<p>NGOs for women in India such as Smile Foundation are not just facilitators. We work to bridge between ambition and achievement. A well-designed CSR programme, implemented through a trusted NGO, can spell the difference between a woman giving up or launching a successful enterprise.</p>



<p>These partnerships also bring flexibility, empathy, and adaptability— qualities large institutions often lack. They can plug gaps in last-mile delivery, offer mentoring, handhold during crises, and celebrate the everyday victories that may never make headlines but are life-changing on the ground.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-swabhiman-model-bridging-the-divide-for-women-entrepreneurs"><strong>Swabhiman model: Bridging the divide</strong> <strong>for women entrepreneurs</strong></h2>



<p>Smile Foundation’s <strong>Swabhiman Women Entrepreneurship Programme</strong> is rooted in the belief that true empowerment stems from the convergence of skills, opportunity, and sustained support. The initiative is designed to uplift underserved women, particularly those from marginalised communities, by enabling them to become economically self-reliant and socially confident.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The programme offers:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Integrated skill training tailored to rural contexts<br></li>



<li>Micro-enterprise incubation with ongoing mentorship<br></li>



<li>Linkages to formal finance and markets<br></li>



<li>Community-based mobilisation that builds trust and ownership<br></li>
</ul>



<p>The outcomes are measurable: rising incomes, improved <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="344" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> and education outcomes, and increased agency for women at the household and community level.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>In 2023-24 alone, the initiative supported more than 1, 90,000 women across the country.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-the-system-stops-social-investment-can-step-in"><strong>Where the system stops, social investment can step in</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Rural women entrepreneurs don’t seek charity, they seek partnership.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>They are determined, resourceful, and ready to lead change within their communities. What they need is access to opportunities, visibility for their efforts, and consistent support to sustain their journey. This is where <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/corporate-social-responsibility-csr-positive-community-impact/" title="Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): Positive Community Impact" data-wpil-monitor-id="1961" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">corporate social responsibility</a> can truly make a difference— not as a one-time intervention, but as a long-term investment in women-led transformation.</p>



<p>Smile Foundation’s <strong>Swabhiman </strong>initiative offers corporates a credible platform to align their CSR goals with inclusive, grassroots development. Through locally relevant vocational training combined with financial and digital literacy, Swabhiman equips women to build and manage sustainable enterprises. The programme cultivates leadership, strengthens life skills, and builds critical market linkages ensuring that economic empowerment goes hand in hand with social mobility.</p>
