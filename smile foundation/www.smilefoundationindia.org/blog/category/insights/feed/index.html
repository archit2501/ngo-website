<p>Well-functioning Anganwadi Centres are the backbone of India’s early childhood development and maternal-child health programmes. Nearly <strong><a href="https://www.godrejfoundation.com/blogs/fifty-years-of-anganwadis-are-they-effective-pre-schools#:~:text=In%202025%2C%20as%20the%20scheme,and%20supplementary%20nutrition%20at%20anganwadis" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">14 lakh Anganwadis</a></strong> across India serve as the first point of contact for nutrition, health monitoring, and preschool education for rural and urban poor children. In 2025, these centres provide hot meals, immunisations and growth tracking for 0–6 year-olds, and critical prenatal/postnatal care to pregnant and lactating women. </p>



<p>ASER 2024 data show that Anganwadis are the biggest provider of pre-primary school services, with over half of all 3–4 year olds enrolled there. These figures highlight that Anganwadis not only fight malnutrition (child undernutrition fell from ~30% in 1975 to 7.7% by 2019–21) but also prime millions of children for school.</p>



<p>Across India, Anganwadis are often simple village centres providing early <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2636" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> and nutrition. Upgrading these facilities as advocated by NEP 2020 is essential for quality learning and <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2634" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-glaring-anganwadi-infrastructure-gaps-undermine-outcomes"><strong>Glaring Anganwadi infrastructure gaps undermine outcomes</strong></h2>



<p>On-the-ground surveys reveal alarming deficits in Anganwadi infrastructure. Recent data from Telangana expose how thousands of centres lack basic amenities. Out of <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/telangana/2025/Jul/02/41-per-cent-anganwadis-lack-electricity-over-30-per-cent-have-no-toilet-facilities#:~:text=Data%20accessed%20by%20TNIE%20reveals,healthy%20and%20dignified%20learning%20environment" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">35,700 Anganwadis</a> surveyed, 41% (14,866 centres) had no electricity, crippling lighting, ventilation, and cold-storage of vaccines and supplements. Similarly, 32.5% (11,595 centres) had no toilet facilities, jeopardising sanitation and dignity, especially for girls and women. And 16.8% (5,981 centres) lacked drinking water access. These gaps directly violate Swachh Bharat and Poshan Abhiyaan goals, and mirror a wider pattern.</p>



<p>A 2020 NITI Aayog review found that a majority of Anganwadis still operate in rented or makeshift spaces, not permanent government-built rooms. The consequences are crumbling walls, overcrowding, and AWWs unable to teach or even cook mid-day meals. For example, in one Odisha Anganwadi shown below, children sit under a leaking roof, illustrating the urgent need for upgrades.</p>



<p>Many Anganwadis today lack safe, child-friendly buildings. In rural Odisha (pictured), a worn-down Anganwadi centre struggles to serve mothers and children in inadequate space, underscoring why state action is needed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="598" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Dz6lhFPWkAI0dEd-1024x598.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14169" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Dz6lhFPWkAI0dEd-1024x598.jpg 1024w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Dz6lhFPWkAI0dEd-300x175.jpg 300w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Dz6lhFPWkAI0dEd-768x448.jpg 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Dz6lhFPWkAI0dEd-1536x896.jpg 1536w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Dz6lhFPWkAI0dEd-1200x700.jpg 1200w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Dz6lhFPWkAI0dEd-1980x1155.jpg 1980w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Dz6lhFPWkAI0dEd.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-case-for-renewed-investment"><strong>The case for renewed investment</strong></h2>



<p>As NEP 2020 notes, the early years are crucial not just for physical development but also cognitive and emotional growth. High-quality, child-friendly infrastructure (safe classrooms, play areas, sanitation, and power) is now explicitly mandated by policy. Indeed, states like UP and Maharashtra are hiring dedicated pre-school teachers and rolling out new curricula in Anganwadis. But to meet these goals, existing centres must be upgraded in tandem.</p>



<p>In practical terms, infrastructure translates to a well-lit, ventilated Anganwadi with clean water and toilets. It boosts attendance, learning and health. In Telangana, Anganwadi Workers report they cannot adopt digital or creative teaching methods without electricity. When toilets and water are absent, young children, and caregivers face illness and indignity. Conversely, interventions that improve the centre environment (e.g. furniture, cooking facilities, kitchen gardens) lead to higher community trust and programme uptake.</p>



<p><strong>Smile Foundation’s own experience confirms this. </strong>With PepsiCo Foundation, Smile implemented the <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/smile-foundation-and-pepsico-join-forces-to-strengthen-healthcare-and-nutrition-for-underserved-communities/#:~:text=Complementing%20this%20effort%20is%20the,community%20engagement%2C%20260%20health%20camps" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Nutrition Enhancement Programme (NEP)</a></strong> in rural Punjab. Over three years, NEP improved maternal-child nutrition in 23 villages of Sangrur, reaching 60,000 people. This CSR-backed initiative directly benefited 16,000 pregnant/lactating women and children and indirectly another 45,000, through 260 health camps, kitchen gardens and AWW training. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ChatGPT-Image-Jul-25-2025-08_29_56-PM-683x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14167" style="width:370px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ChatGPT-Image-Jul-25-2025-08_29_56-PM-683x1024.png 683w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ChatGPT-Image-Jul-25-2025-08_29_56-PM-200x300.png 200w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ChatGPT-Image-Jul-25-2025-08_29_56-PM-768x1152.png 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ChatGPT-Image-Jul-25-2025-08_29_56-PM.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></figure>



<p>Likewise, in Kosi (Mathura, UP), the recent <strong><a href="https://thecsrjournal.in/corporate-social-responsibility-csr-news-pepsico-india-and-smile-foundation-partner-to-combat-anaemia-and-malnutrition-in-kosi-through-pink-smile-initiative/#:~:text=,Officer%20of%20the%20Nandgaon%20block" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Pink Smile</a></strong> project (PepsiCo–Smile) deployed mobile medical units and community camps to screen and treat anemia for 4,200 vulnerable women and children. These projects underscore how supporting Anganwadi-based care yields immediate health gains.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smile-foundation-s-anganwadi-infrastructure-initiatives"><strong>Smile Foundation’s Anganwadi infrastructure initiatives</strong></h2>



<p>Building on this evidence, Smile Foundation has launched dedicated Anganwadi infrastructure programmes through <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" title="Corporate Partnerships" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2635" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">CSR</a> partnerships. In Maharashtra, the <strong><a href="https://thecsrjournal.in/csr-news-non-profit-foundations-empower-lives-anganwadi-transformation-pune/#:~:text=,Anganwadi%20workers%20and%20local%20families" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Mars Wrigley Foundation’s Community Connection grant</a></strong> empowered us to revamp 10 Anganwadi Centres (AWCs) across Pune. Over 2024–25 we revitalised 10 AWCs, impacting 13 centres overall, reaching 1,562 direct beneficiaries (children, mothers, adolescent girls) and 4,660 community members. </p>



<p>Key upgrades included 202 kitchen gardens to improve food security, 30 health/haemoglobin screening camps, and training for Anganwadi workers. We provided furniture, learning materials and safe sanitation creating cleaner, child-friendly learning spaces.</p>



<p>Similarly, under our <strong>Women Empowerment (<a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/women-empowerment/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Swabhiman</a>)</strong> programme in Tamil Nadu, Odisha and other states, Smile has supported Anganwadi upgrades by building toilets, installing solar lights, and water filters, and training AWWs in hygiene and nutrition. Our anaemia and nutrition mobile units also regularly link families to their Anganwadi Centres. All these efforts from Assam to Andhra Pradesh illustrate Smile’s conviction that investing in Anganwadis today builds healthier, more educated communities tomorrow.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-practical-csr-partnerships-for-lasting-impact"><strong>Practical CSR partnerships for lasting impact</strong></h2>



<p>For CSR leaders seeking high-impact opportunities, Anganwadi upgradation should be a strategic priority. We recommend:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Adopt &amp; Upgrade:</strong> Corporates can &#8216;adopt&#8217; clusters of Anganwadis (or a mini-Anganwadi cluster) in partnership with NGOs like us. Funding can go to core infrastructure like permanent classrooms, clean toilets, borewells or piped water, electricity/smart lighting, boundary walls, and kitchen equipment.</li>



<li><strong>Nutrition &amp; Nurture:</strong> Enhance the centre’s nutrition role by sponsoring kitchen gardens, community nutrition workshops, and improved kitchen-cum-store facilities. These immediately improve the meal program’s reach.</li>



<li><strong>Capacity Building:</strong> Invest in training Anganwadi workers (AWWs/AWHs) on early childhood pedagogy, health screening, digital tools and gender sensitivity so that physical upgrades yield programme quality gains.</li>



<li><strong>Monitoring &amp; Community:</strong> Collaborate with local panchayats and beneficiaries in planning; involve employees as volunteers (e.g. helping refurbish centres). Set measurable outcomes (enrollment, health indicators, attendance) and share progress publicly.</li>
</ul>



<p>The government’s own task force advises that <strong>public-private partnerships (PPPs)</strong> are vital to bridge the gap in ICDS service delivery. By partnering with NGOs like Smile Foundation who bring field expertise, CSR units can ensure sustainable models. For example, Mars Wrigley’s multi-year support combined fresh infrastructure inputs with IEC campaigns and AWW training. Such integrated projects create lasting change far beyond a one-time donation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-child-friendly-futures"><strong>Building child-friendly futures</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="869" height="813" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-202910.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14168" style="width:372px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-202910.png 869w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-202910-300x281.png 300w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-202910-768x719.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></figure>



<p>Well-equipped Anganwadi centres are an enabler of national development. They lay the foundation for healthier, smarter generations. </p>



<p>Smile Foundation calls on policymakers and CSR leaders to make Anganwadi upgradation a national mission. By collectively funding and maintaining model Anganwadis, India can accelerate the goals of POSHAN Abhiyaan, Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao, and universal preschool education. Every rupee invested yields returns in reduced malnutrition, better schooling outcomes and empowered mothers. We urge CSR heads to engage <a href="cp@smilefoundationindia.org" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">now</a>. Your strategic CSR priorities can transform Anganwadis into vibrant community hubs, ensuring no child misses out on a strong start in life.</p>



<p><strong>Sources:</strong> Government and media reports highlight the infrastructural shortfalls in Anganwadis, and policy analyses recommend urgent upgrades. The outcomes of Smile Foundation’s CSR partnerships (with PepsiCo, Mars Wrigley, etc.) document the impact of targeted Anganwadi improvements. All facts and figures above are drawn from these reports and our project data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Technology is frequently viewed as complicated and dull. For many people, it may appear daunting. This belief derives from the fact that only engineers and coders work with technology, data, and algorithms. However, when it comes to modern technology, there is something for everyone. It can be dynamic, inventive, and entertaining. In fact, technology not only provides you with employable&nbsp;abilities, but it also opens up a plethora of new opportunities. Consider the use of technology in the classroom: gamified learning, movies, puzzles, and animations; there are far too many possibilities that have made <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2405" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> more enjoyable. For those in the midst of building a career, it has opened up new prospects beyond engineering. Beyond&nbsp;education and employment, technology has transformed the way we live at home.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Exciting creative fields in technology</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.creativelive.com/blog/25-creative-jobs-career-paths-for-creative-people/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Several careers blend creativity and technology today.</a> For instance, video game design combines skills in computer programming, graphic art, animation, and storytelling. Designers often collaborate in teams to leverage their creative talents to produce engaging games that reach wide audiences. In the realm of social media, professionals promote a company&#8217;s products and services across various platforms. Their responsibilities include crafting different types of posts, maintaining business profiles, and developing significant marketing initiatives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Graphic designers utilize specialized software to create visuals and artwork that organizations and individuals can use for promoting concepts, events, products, and more. Animators are creative experts who apply their artistic and design skills, along with technology, to produce animations for various formats, such as films, TV shows, <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/beyond-the-screen-negative-effects-of-video-games-on-children/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">video games</a>, and others. A UX (user experience) designer focuses on using their design and analytical abilities to enhance the usability of products for consumers. They may work on developing mobile applications or new technological devices. Video editors edit recorded footage for films, television programmes, corporate advertisements, and online videos (games, corporate, educational, etc.). Illustrators, painters, craft makers, etc., have endless <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/women-empowerment-break-barriers-and-create-opportunities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">opportunities to create</a> their products, enhance them digitally and sell or showcase them online. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Technology for personal expression</strong></h2>



<p>Technology if used appropriately then it has ample opportunities for those who want to express themselves in innovative ways. People have built successful careers with the right use of technology and their own talents. Platforms like YouTube enable creators to share narratives, produce music, and craft visually impressive videos that can be viewed by audiences worldwide. While gaming may face criticism, devoted gamers have leveraged their passion to launch gaming channels that have blossomed into successful careers, earning them global recognition. <a href="https://amberstudent.com/blog/post/top-10-educational-youtube-channels" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Education and e-learning</a> have evolved into fiercely competitive sectors, with educators increasingly assuming the roles of influencers and bloggers. Educators across all disciplines have utilised YouTube to disseminate their effective teaching strategies and methodologies. They use creative methods to <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/teaching-children-the-universal-language-kindness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">teach children</a> in fun ways and help make education exciting.</p>



<p>Blogs serve as a platform for writers and <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/teachers-as-thought-leaders/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">thought leaders</a> to convey their ideas, experiences, and knowledge, influencing discussions across various fields. Vloggers utilize video as a medium to engage with their audience, focusing on specific topics or themes such as beauty, travel or cooking. They often cultivate a following by fostering a personal connection with viewers and sharing their own experiences, opinions, and viewpoints. Not to forget podcasts! A podcast is a digital medium that consists of audio episodes based on a certain theme. Podcasters often record, edit, and publish digital content with their audience. They can post on YouTube, upload audio files to a podcast hosting provider, or broadcast the podcast episode directly from their website.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Learning Using technology&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Learning something new as a hobby or to upskill does not require enrolling in an offline course and commuting to class or taking notes. <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/career-change/best-online-learning-platforms/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Online education platforms</a> allow you to learn from home at your own pace. They provide tests and quizzes that are less stressful and time-consuming than those offered in traditional classroom settings. Their benefits include cost-effectiveness, innovation, fun, and flexibility, to name a few.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Technology at home</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://insightss.co/blogs/the-rise-of-the-smart-home-how-technology-is-changing-the-way-we-live/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Our homes are now filled with diverse advanced devices</a>, such as smart TVs, personalised health trackers, intelligent lighting, and virtual assistants. Many of these technologies are beneficial, enhancing urban sustainability, boosting productivity, and alleviating work-related stress. Smart meters provide users with near real-time data on energy consumption, enabling better energy management, cost savings, and reduced emissions. Virtual assistants like Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, and Google’s Home are increasingly common in households, responding to voice commands to perform various tasks, from playing music and delivering weather updates to providing cooking tips. For those concerned about security, smart doorbells offer peace of mind by allowing homeowners to receive notifications on their phones, see who is at the door, and communicate with them if necessary.</p>



<p>In conclusion, despite criticism regarding dependency, misuse, and privacy issues, the responsible use of technology can greatly benefit both individuals and the environment. Technology is far from dull; consider a different angle, it offers limitless potential and transformative capabilities. So why not leverage technology, experiment with it and have some fun to create a better world?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smile’s use of technology in learning programs</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Smile Foundation</a> is actively integrating digital classrooms into its educational initiatives to enhance learning experiences for children across India. By leveraging technology, the foundation aims to make <a href="https://donate.smilefoundationindia.org/donate-for-education/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">education</a> more engaging, interactive, and accessible.</p>



<p>In regions like Meghalaya, Smile Foundation has changed traditional learning environments by introducing digital classrooms equipped with modern technological tools. This shift from conventional blackboards to digital platforms has been complemented by the installation of solar power systems, ensuring uninterrupted learning despite power challenges.</p>



<p>We recognize the potential of digital learning to bridge educational gaps, especially among children of low-income families. By making digital learning accessible, the foundation aims to reduce disparities and provide equal learning opportunities for all students.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One in every 10 children worldwide is differently abled. Globally, 15 percent of people, including at least 240 million children, are differently abled. Yet, their representation on the global platform or nation/region-specific is highly uneven, which stems from a lack of understanding of their needs.<br><br><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/do-slum-children-need-special-attention/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Children with special needs</a> have long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairment in engaging with their surroundings, and this essentially hinders their participation in society on an equal basis with others. However, children and adolescents with special needs represent a diverse community with a range of life experiences. The extent to which they are accepted and included in society and lead fulfilling lives largely depends on how our institutions and communities understand and accommodate their needs.<br><br>No matter their story, every child has every right to thrive and be accepted.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Inclusivity: Understanding the needs</strong></h2>



<p>Children with special needs are often made to feel outside the crowd. To make them feel inclusive, one must have a nuanced understanding of their unique needs and the specific <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/challenges-faced-by-a-good-mother/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">challenges they face</a> on a day-to-day basis. These children are often born with or develop physical, emotional, intellectual, and learning challenges. This requires building and constantly working towards an inclusive environment that helps them with tailored support.<br><br>By highlighting the special needs of differently abled children, we emphasize the importance of specialized care, education, and therapeutic interventions.</p>



<p>Children with physical limitations require the continuous support of mobility aids and devices like wheelchairs, walkers, communication technology, sensory aids, and so on to live more safely and independently. Besides this, they require specialized physical therapy for increased motor skills. Institutions must have the necessary resources to support the needs of the differently-abled children with physical deformities to support them in their pursuit. To allow differently-abled children to utilize mobility equipment or walk about securely, clear up places and minimize bumps and surface level variations. To make it easy and comfortable for them to sit, provide a range of seating alternatives, such as a floor, chair, side table, blanket, and cushion.<br><br>For children with visual limitations, arrange furniture or place a rope along the wall to help your child walk around safely, and provide objects with various textures, shapes, sizes, and weights, like jute, wool, or cotton, for sensory exploration. Keep toys and learning materials within easy reach, remove unnecessary items from the play area, and minimize noise during play or learning time. For children with low vision, use large pictures or contrasting colours to distinguish areas like doors from walls, and reduce glare by using curtains, blinds, or cloth to cover windows.<br><br>Similarly, for children who need hearing aids, create an environment where you communicate using sign language, gestures, and visual cues. Face the child so they can see you. Minimize background noise and distractions, like TVs or phones, to help them focus. Point to objects or pictures during conversations or reading, and label items around the house to support their learning.</p>



<p>For children with intellectual and emotional limitations, an inclusive educational and learning environment is the key. Individualized educational strategies are necessary with special education programs catering to their cognitive abilities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Inclusive education should be the focus</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/inclusive-education-focus-on-children-with-special-needs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Children with special needs gain a great deal from inclusive</a> education as it allows them to study within a nurturing setting. In addition to meeting students&#8217; academic needs, inclusive classrooms promote acceptance and social <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" title="Livelihood" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="663" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">skill development</a>. To customize educational experiences to each child&#8217;s specific requirements, Individualised Education Programs (IEPs) are crucial tools.</p>



<p>Discrimination and stigma are the main causes of the ongoing obstacles that children with disabilities experience throughout their educational journey. They are therefore frequently enrolled in segregated schools and are among the most likely to be absent from school. Many people lose out on chances to acquire and hone skills necessary for work, self-sufficiency, and active engagement in their communities.&nbsp;<br><br>Hence, children with special needs often work hard to accommodate themselves to an inaccessible world that excludes them. But they are not problems that need to be fixed or changed. Children with special needs are a part of the diversity of human experience: Everybody has functional restrictions at some point in their lives, and special needs are a part of the diversity of human experience. The degree to which we are willing to face obstacles to change will determine how happy children with impairments can live.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Helping children with special needs feel secured</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Show understanding and patience</strong><br>Allow extra time and patience for them to do their tasks, recognizing their struggles without frustration. Pay attention and try to understand what they’re communicating.</p>



<p><strong>Treat special needs as a natural part of life</strong><br>Approach their needs with acceptance, helping them feel secure and valued without making it the focus.</p>



<p><strong>Encourage inclusive friendships</strong><br>Support children with special needs to forge friendships with every kind of peer group to foster confidence and reduce insecurity.</p>



<p><strong>Promote decision-making and independence</strong><br>Let them make choices and take on responsibilities while teaching the difference between right and wrong.</p>



<p><strong>Avoid forcing tasks</strong><br>Never push them beyond their physical, mental, and emotional abilities. Respect their preferences and understand their reasons for hesitation.</p>



<p><strong>Provide consistent support<br></strong>Celebrate their talents, encourage their efforts, and stand by them in all situations to boost their confidence and happiness.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smile&#8217;s Mission Education</strong></h2>



<p>Nurturing a child with special needs could be challenging but a true democratic spirit always lies in making every right accessible to all children. Under the <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Mission Education</a> program, Smile Foundation has joined hands with different organizations to build <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/809682257641341" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">an integrated approach to development</a> and education for a vast number of differently-abled children in India. With its Mission education program, we continue to ensure that every child thrives despite their physical, intellectual, and emotional limitations.<br><br><br></p>

<p><strong><em>Take the Good from the West, but the Countries Themselves Know Best</em></strong></p>



<p>Education is a profound force shaping societies, driving economies, and cultivating identities. For nations in the Global South, many of which bear the enduring imprint of colonial rule, education stands as a symbol of hope—a medium to reclaim autonomy, nurture cultural heritage, and chart a path toward progress. Colonial powers once imposed Western curricula and ideologies, displacing indigenous knowledge systems and eroding local cultural practices. Today, these nations are at a crossroads. They are poised to draw from the West&#8217;s advancements while asserting their unique identities, crafting <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2397" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> systems that reflect their histories, cultures, and aspirations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A legacy of colonization: The impact on education systems</strong></h2>



<p>The colonial past left an indelible mark on education across Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Colonizers prioritized their imperial interests, replacing local knowledge with Western curricula. In India, for instance, the British established an English-medium education system to create an intermediary class for governance, sidelining regional languages and traditional gurukul-based learning systems. Similarly, in African nations, colonial powers imposed Eurocentric education models, elevating European languages while marginalizing native ones.</p>



<p>This legacy perpetuated dependence on Western paradigms, often alienating students from their cultural roots. However, post-independence, these nations began acknowledging the need to reimagine their education systems. This reimagining wasn’t just a nod to history but a vital strategy to foster socio-economic growth and national pride.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>But, what does decolonizing education mean?</strong></h2>



<p>By decolonizing education, the countries aim to reclaim the authority to define what and how their students learn. It involves integrating indigenous knowledge, contextualizing curricula to reflect local realities, challenging Eurocentric narratives, and addressing inequalities entrenched by colonial systems. This transformation is not just about revisiting the past but also about rethinking the future.</p>



<p><a href="https://globalchallenges.ch/issue/14/higher-education-decolonisation-and-the-global-south/#:~:text=To%20ensure%20that%20the%20process,higher%20education%20institutions&#039;%20modus%20operandi." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">Decolonizing education</a> involves rethinking traditional pedagogies and research methodologies, which may not be suitable for Indigenous or marginalized communities. It requires critically reevaluating values such as &#8220;meritocracy&#8221; and &#8220;competitiveness,&#8221; recognizing their cultural and contextual significance. To ensure inclusivity, the decolonization process must involve collaboration with diverse stakeholders—students, faculty, Indigenous leaders, and marginalized groups—leading to more inclusive knowledge production. Given the trauma caused by colonialism, reimagining higher education in the Global South also serves as a means of reconciliation and healing, both within educational institutions and across society.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Let’s face some truths…</strong></h2>



<p>Decolonizing education is a challenging task, as colonial systems have long shaped societal structures, governance, and global interactions. Reversing this legacy requires dismantling deeply ingrained ideologies and reintroducing marginalized knowledge systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A 2015 report by India’s Ministry of Human Resource Development reveals that the annual secondary school dropout rate among Indigenous children exceeds 40%, significantly higher than the national average of 25%. This disparity is rooted in the lasting impact of colonialism, with the disconnect between the medium of instruction and students’ native languages creating barriers to understanding. Additionally, the lack of culturally relevant content further marginalizes Indigenous communities, perpetuating cycles of exclusion and disadvantage.</p>



<p>A name stands out in the fight against this challenge. <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2020/2/10/the-indian-school-where-indigenous-children-are-never-outsiders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">Boro Baski</a>, an educator from West Bengal, is dedicated to preserving indigenous culture through education. He heads Bishnubati Adibasi Marshall, a school dedicated to preserving and promoting the Santali community&#8217;s language, traditions, and cultural arts. The school adopts a holistic approach, integrating indigenous knowledge with modern education to ensure that Santali children remain connected to their cultural roots while gaining the skills necessary to thrive in contemporary society.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Where does the Global South stand?</strong></h2>



<p>The countries of the Global South have come a long way since gaining independence and are in a quest to reclaim and reinforce their cultural identities.</p>



<p>Take India, for instance. Its National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasizes the importance of multilingual education by promoting regional languages alongside English. The policy seeks to revive indigenous knowledge systems, such as Ayurveda and yoga. However, simultaneously, India has embraced Western innovations in STEM education and digital learning, ensuring its students remain competitive globally.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1753-59132021000100005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">South Africa</a>, the post-apartheid era ushered in significant educational reforms following the #FeesMustFall (FMF) movement and the student protests of 2015-2016 calling for decolonisation of the curriculum. School curricula was revised to reflect the nation’s diverse histories and cultures, with African languages introduced in early education to reclaim cultural identity while maintaining global relevance in science and technology education.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268814825_Decolonising_Bolivian_Education_Ideology_Versus_Reality" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Bolivia </a>offers another compelling example. Its &#8220;Education Reform 1994&#8221; incorporates indigenous languages and worldviews into the national curriculum, honoring its multicultural identity, while simultaneously embracing global standards.</p>



<p>These efforts underscore that decolonizing education is not about rejecting Western advancements but about selective integration. The challenge lies in balancing these global assets with local relevance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why does decolonizing education matter?</strong></h2>



<p>Decolonizing education is not merely an endeavor towards cultural preservation; it is a socio-economic imperative. Education systems rooted in local contexts are more likely to address pressing issues like poverty, inequality, and climate change. Indigenous knowledge systems offer valuable insights into sustainable practices, community <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1399" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a>, and conflict resolution—areas where Western frameworks often fall short.</p>



<p>Moreover, reclaiming educational sovereignty empowers nations to chart their development paths. It instills a sense of pride and identity among students, enabling them to contribute meaningfully to their societies while engaging with the global community on equal terms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The end note</strong></h2>



<p>The journey of the Global South in decolonizing education is a testament to the resilience and vision of its people. Political resistance and the deep-seated influence of colonial legacies&nbsp; pose significant barriers, making the process challenging. Yet, countries are finding innovative ways forward. By blending the strengths of Western education with indigenous knowledge systems, these nations are forging pathways that are both globally competitive and rooted in local heritage. As the Global South addresses historical injustices, it offers the world an inspiring message: Progress thrives when diversity is celebrated, and true innovation emerges when we trust that each nation, with its unique history and aspirations, knows best what it needs.</p>

<p><em>“We slaughter one another in our words and attitudes. We slaughter one another in the stereotypes and mistrust that linger in our heads, and the words of hate we spew from our lips.”- Nelson Mandela&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Growing up, we all have been perpetrators of stereotypes in our ways, victims of rumors that have been going around for decades, perhaps centuries. As children and adolescents, little do we understand the impact stereotyping has on individuals and why it is detrimental to the thought process and growth of a community and society. However, as we grow and unlearn our societal beliefs and begin to understand the need to treat individuals as they are, we learn acceptance and help each other grow.<br><br>While there might be some level of truth giving rise to certain stereotypes, largely, it serves as a means to falsely generalize individuals, creating a distorted view towards people from different countries, races, religions, and communities, leading to discrimination.<br><br>As the famous author Chimamanda Adichie says, stereotypes are nothing but “a danger of a single story.” They only let us believe what we want to on a surface level.<br><br>A stereotype leads us to believe that all people belonging to the same group or community share the same characteristics and behave in the same way. If we think back, we may recall that we all have thought in this way at some point in our life, about people from different communities, cultures, and beliefs. And these notions/stereotypes don’t appear from nowhere—they are derived from the perceptions and experiences of particular individuals from certain groups and then extrapolated to a whole group. But what we often forget is that each individual is more than just their group members. </p>



<p>Their identity and characteristics are beyond their roots, and accepting them as they are will only help them grow more as an individual with strong personalities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fighting stereotypes at the workplace &#8211; where stereotypes are most prevalent&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>With growing chatters about inclusion and diversity taking over workplaces, stereotyping often creates bad press for organizations. Stereotypes in different forms &#8211; gender, race, sexism, religious affiliation, and so on — create negative feelings and form prejudices against individuals, impacting their mental <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1398" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> and ability to grow and flourish inside an organization.<br><br>While these stereotypes are often subtle but often, they are not. The most impacted are those, who are from marginalized and disadvantaged communities and do not know the right ways to combat such harmful perceptions, which are not understood or felt in the open.<br><br>It is not easy to make stereotypes disappear from the collective consciousness because these stereotypes in workplaces help maintain power imbalances. Such a culture is mostly enabled by senior employees and the management, to retain power and influence within organisational cohorts. For instance, age-related stereotypes are one of the most common phenomena in today’s work culture. Often called ageism – it is a conflict of views and perceptions between the youth workforce and those who have been serving the organization for long. While younger generations have a way of judging older workers as ‘boomers’ for their lack of awareness around social issues, conversely, senior employees, often ruling the management, look down upon the youth workers for being too self-indulgent and assertive. When these dynamics conflict, it influences management decisions and promotions. Following this, workers may lose motivation and enthusiasm in doing their work if they are subjected to unrelenting criticism or are not given well-earned promotions as a result of stereotyping. Employee retention, productivity, and morale all suffer as a result.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Breaking stereotypes; let individuals grow</strong></h2>



<p>Whether it is an organization, educational institution, or community, each institution must take accountability and devise ways of overcoming stereotypes, often ingrained in institutional dynamics and societal conscience. Much of this can be done through addressing these issues openly, through individual and cultural interventions, learning to embrace diversity, raising awareness and so on.<br><br>In institutions, diversity and inclusion seminars are excellent settings to practice this and learn more about each other the damage stereotyping can impose on different groups and what you can do to break the cycle. Unfortunately, stereotyping is a conditioned habit people are often unaware of; however, with collaboration and a willingness to learn, you can chip away at its power.<br><br>To emerge from a bubble, more interactions need to occur with individuals from different races, communities, genders, etc. By learning more about each other, those who don’t share the same beliefs can gradually recondition one’s perceptions. Further, hiring a diverse workforce can also help mitigate stereotypes and create an inclusive work environment for everyone to thrive.<br><br>Learning about race and racism is good in this context, but it’s not enough. It is also important to establish reciprocal relationships with people from other groups. Being in equal-status relationships with people from different backgrounds enables us to see them as complete human beings—members of their social groups, to be sure, but unique in their particular set of personal experiences and characteristics.</p>



<p>Just as policies and regulations influence behavior, accepted cultural norms affect how employees treat one another. While these rules are unwritten, they can indicate what’s appropriate and inappropriate in the workplace. For example, some organizations may not have explicit policies on how employees from different backgrounds should interact but with awareness and learning seminars, leadership can actively avoid permitting racism within their company cultures. Doing so gives employees a sense of what behavior they’ll be socially praised or scorned for.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Breaking gender stereotypes </strong></h2>



<p>Recognizing the need to fight stereotypes to educate the youth of India, <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Smile Foundation</a>’s flagship program, ‘<a href="https://donate.smilefoundationindia.org/donate-for-girl-child" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">She Can Fly</a>’ has been instrumental in fighting gender stereotypes in rural India. Challenging gender stereotypes in classrooms can build classrooms that help in fostering equality and respecting individuals from diverse backgrounds. This also lets educators rise above societal limitations and break down barriers to let each other grow with strong individuality.</p>



<p>Change may be gradual, but it begins with small, conscious steps. As we continue to challenge and break stereotypes in all areas of life, we cultivate not only acceptance but also a shared commitment to equality, individuality, and mutual growth. Together, we can create a world where no one is held back by the weight of preconceived notions—a world where everyone can truly thrive.</p>

Guided by the slogan &#8220;In Solidarity for a Green World,&#8221; the conference led to important dialogue exchange on the ongoing struggle to combat climate change. Branded as the “finance COP,” the conference emphasized the importance of securing resources to address the climate crisis. For South Asia, a region disproportionately vulnerable to rising seas, erratic monsoons, and devastating cyclones, the stakes have never been higher. The outcomes of COP29 offer a mixed bag, highlighting the urgent need for equitable finance, regional cooperation, and innovative adaptation strategies to secure a sustainable future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>South Asia: The Epicenter of Climate Vulnerability</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://thediplomat.com/2024/11/cop29-outcomes-and-south-asian-concerns/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">South Asia</a> is home to nearly a quarter of the global population but accounts for only a fraction of global greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, the region faces disproportionate impacts of climate change. Bangladesh, for instance, loses about 1.5% of its GDP annually to climate-related disasters. Meanwhile, India, with its sprawling coastline and dependence on monsoon agriculture, faces mounting losses from floods and droughts. According to a World Bank report, by 2050, climate change could force over 40 million people in South Asia to migrate internally.</p>



<p>The region’s vulnerability stems from its geographic and socio-economic characteristics. Himalayan countries like Nepal face glacial melts and erratic monsoon rains, while island nations like the Maldives confront rising sea levels. Pakistan’s 2022 floods, which displaced 7.9 million people and caused <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2024/11/cop29-outcomes-and-south-asian-concerns/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">$30 billion in economic losses</a>, underscore the urgency of addressing climate-induced loss and damage. Despite these dire circumstances, COP29 outcomes have left significant gaps in addressing the region’s needs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Climate Finance: A Lifeline or a Mirage?</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most contentious issues at COP29 was the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance. The agreement to <a href="https://m.economictimes.com/news/india/cop29-india-says-climate-deal-falls-short/articleshow/115633632.cms" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">mobilize $300 billion</a> annually by 2035 marks a step forward but falls woefully short of the $1.3 trillion needed annually by 2030 for developing nations. For South Asia, this financing gap poses a major barrier to implementing crucial adaptation and mitigation projects.</p>



<p>India strongly criticized the proposed increase as “too little, too distant” to meet the urgent needs of developing countries. Harjeet Singh, a prominent climate activist, described the outcome as offering “false hope” and abandoning vulnerable communities to face immense challenges alone. The emphasis on loans rather than grants, termed by experts as “climate colonialism,” risks plunging countries into debt cycles. Bangladesh, for instance, has expressed concerns over the lack of debt relief measures and the reliance on multilateral development banks to mobilize climate funds predominantly through loans.</p>



<p>The Green Climate Fund (GCF), seen as crucial for developing nations, has plans to triple its funding by 2030. However, without strong systems to focus on the most vulnerable countries, South Asia&#8217;s climate efforts remain uncertain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Energy Transition</strong></h2>



<p>The Global Stocktake at COP29 emphasized the critical need to transition away from fossil fuels to achieve the 1.5°C target. For South Asia, where fossil fuels still account for over 60% of the energy mix, this transition is fraught with challenges. Balancing economic growth with decarbonization remains a delicate act.</p>



<p>India’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) include an ambitious target to achieve 50% cumulative electric power capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. However, the absence of clear guidelines on coal phase-outs and fossil fuel subsidies at COP29 reflects the persistent divide between developed and developing nations. India has called for tailored energy transition strategies that do not impose undue obligations but instead provide support to achieve energy goals equitably.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Adaptation and Resilience: The Need for Grassroots Solutions</strong></h2>



<p>While mitigation often dominates climate dialogues, adaptation is crucial for South Asia’s survival. Discussions at COP29 on the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) made progress by identifying indicators to track adaptation efforts. However, the increased focus on large-scale, long-term changes risks overshadowing immediate, practical needs.</p>



<p>Bangladesh’s National Adaptation Plan prioritizes flood-resilient infrastructure and early warning systems. Yet, funding remains a major challenge. Nepal, struggling with glacial melt and erratic monsoons, sought global recognition of the disproportionate impacts on Himalayan countries and funding for resilience-building projects. The deadlock over National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) at COP29 adds to the challenges, leaving countries like the Maldives without clear support.</p>



<p>Localized adaptation strategies, such as mangrove restoration in the Sundarbans and drought-resistant crops in Rajasthan, offer promising solutions. However, these efforts hinge on equitable finance and technology transfers, areas where COP29 made strides but also exposed gaps.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Regional Cooperation: A Missed Opportunity</strong></h2>



<p>Climate change knows no borders, yet regional cooperation in South Asia remains elusive. With Himalayan glaciers melting at alarming rates, the water security of millions is under dire threat. Geopolitical tensions have hindered initiatives like the South Asia Co-operative Environment Programme (SACEP), and critical issues like transboundary water management were inadequately addressed at COP29.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2024/11/cop29-outcomes-and-south-asian-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">Indus Waters Treaty</a> between India and Pakistan is an example of the strain climate stress can place on cross-border agreements. Rising sea levels, desertification, and extreme weather events are driving significant migration from coastal areas to urban centers, further complicating regional dynamics. Shared solutions to shared problems, such as cooperative flood management and regional energy grids, are essential but remain underexplored.</p>



<p>COP29 highlighted the urgent need for funding and global cooperation to fight climate change. For South Asia, the stakes couldn’t be higher—livelihoods, ecosystems, and future generations hang in the balance. Though some progress was made, the lack of accountability and fair financing undermines trust in global efforts. As the world prepares for COP30, it is imperative to move from rhetoric to action. Only through equitable finance, technology transfers, and inclusive policies can we hope to secure a sustainable future for South Asia and the planet. The question remains: Will the world rise to the occasion, or will the voices of the vulnerable continue to be drowned in the clamor of global inaction?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smile Foundation’s active contribution&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Smile Foundation</a> actively contributes to climate action in South Asia through various initiatives aimed at education, food security, and resilience building. Recognizing the profound impact of climate change on children&#8217;s <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2396" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a>, the foundation highlights how extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, disrupt schooling in South Asian countries. To address this, Smile Foundation emphasizes the integration of climate adaptation measures into educational policies, ensuring that learning environments remain conducive despite climatic challenges. </p>



<p>In the realm of food security, Smile Foundation&#8217;s &#8216;Plate Half Full&#8217; initiative provides mid-day meals to children in schools across India. This program not only combats hunger but also educates communities about proper nutrition, thereby building resilience against the adverse effects of climate change on food availability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, the foundation underscores the importance of Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) programs in building resilience to climate change. By ensuring access to clean water and sanitation, these initiatives help communities adapt to climate-induced challenges, such as water scarcity and <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1397" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> issues, thereby enhancing their overall resilience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through these multifaceted efforts, Smile Foundation aligns with the outcomes of COP29, addressing critical issues like education disruption, food insecurity, and the need for grassroots adaptation strategies in South Asia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Eighteen years ago, when Dr Prahalathan KK went to teach children in an orphanage, no photos were taken of the event. Today, an image of a person that looks uncannily like him can be created in a similar setting, thanks to artificial intelligence (AI). “It protects the privacy of the children and the generated image can be used for any communication purposes,” says Dr Prahalathan, co-founder of Bhumi, a Chennai-based non-profit which aims to drive social change by fostering an environment where young adults and children learn, lead, and thrive.</p>



<p>Bhumi is using AI to help streamline their activities. “We are still using it at a very basic level, such as for image creation. We also use an AI note taker, which is able to organise information and highlight points, and volunteers and Bhumi fellows use AI to create lesson plans,” he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How can the non-profit sector use AI?</strong></h2>



<p>AI is being used across sectors and industries to make job processes more efficient. But are Indian non-profits open to using it? According to an article, even as (AI) surges in popularity, with 73% of internet users in India exposed to it in some capacity, the <a href="https://idronline.org/article/technology/are-indian-nonprofits-ready-for-ai/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">social sector is still at a nascent stage</a> when it comes to using AI.</p>



<p>GivingTuesday recently conducted an AI readiness assessment to investigate the deployment and usage of AI in the non-profit landscape. It highlights how nonprofits in India are utilising it, their comfort levels with various AI tools, and the challenges they experience. </p>



<p>Among the surveyed organisations, 55% had used generative AI to write text or create images. In contrast, 30% of organisations had never used any form of it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Benefits of using AI</strong></h2>



<p>Nonprofits can use AI to streamline many of their processes, including fundraising and generating reports, says Irfan Bashir, co-founder, DaanVeda, an AI-powered fundraising intelligence automation and payment platform for nonprofits.</p>



<p>“There are two types of fundraising – individual giving where people, philanthropists or high net worth individuals donate money; and institutional giving, which includes grants given by foundations, corporate <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" title="Corporate Partnerships" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="398" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">CSR</a>, etc,” says Bashir.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The entire fundraising journey involves several steps. “The first is discovery, where you have to look for opportunities, then comes prospecting where you try to understand if the opportunity is relevant to your NGO or not, then lead generation once you identify the relevant opportunity you want to know the details of the key decision makers in the organisation and their contact details,” says Bashir. After that, you have relationship building and cultivation where you reach out to the donor, and then proposal building where you write and submit proposals.</p>



<p>“Later, you get the donation, close it, look into compliance, and then comes reporting and renewals as you need to give personalised reports to donors about how their money has been utilised, and, if they are happy with it, there would be renewals,” says Bashir, adding that nonprofits face different problems at all of these steps. “They may not know how to identify funding opportunities, which are relevant to them or who the key decision makers in donor organisations are. Personalised reports are also very resource intensive and an added burden on the programme team.”</p>



<p>That’s where AI comes in. “Once you have more donor intelligence, it should be easy to find relevant donors. We have built a huge database of donors,” says Bashir. “We also use generative AI solutions to create proposals, donation appeals and personalised reports,” says Bashir, whose organisation has 35 paying clients.</p>



<p>“AI is a good tool for the nonprofit sector. Non-profits get stuck in operational loops. A Harvard study revealed that non-their profits spent 18% of revenue on fundraising operations. Our goal with AI is to bring the cost down from 18% to at least 10%,” he says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Organisational capacity is not a strong predictor of readiness, says study</strong></h3>



<p>According to GivingTuesday, high-capacity organisations are better positioned to improve their AI readiness and would benefit more from such improvements. But overall, organisational capacity is not a strong predictor of readiness.</p>



<p>Early adopters of AI tended to be larger organisations with greater resources and infrastructure. These were predominantly located in urban areas, had more staff, and demonstrated higher levels of data collection and technical capacity, which helped them experiment with and implement AI in more advanced ways. These organisations were also more likely to have formal data-use policies, cloud-based data storage, and technical personnel such as IT staff or MERL experts—all of which contribute to their ability to adopt AI more effectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In contrast, late adopters of AI were smaller organisations with fewer staff members and constrained budgets. Only 10% of late adopters expressed interest in using AI for applications beyond generative AI. The current data use of early adopters remains manual and tabular, which suggests that they have a long way to go when it comes to AI adoption, says the <em>IDR</em> article.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Indian organisations more open to using AI</strong></h2>



<p>Compared to the global average, Indian organisations were more comfortable using AI at work—29% gave it a score of 10 on a scale of 0–10, says the survey. They also focused more on the benefits of AI and had fewer concerns about data protection/privacy issues. So, they are more likely to share data without having data-use or sharing agreements in place compared to the global average. The research suggests that this might be because in India, the culture and legislative landscape around data protection regulation is at a nascent stage.</p>



<p>“Our early testing users crossed 50 NGOs, including Bhumi. And we now have 35 paying customers,” says Bashir.</p>



<p>The study suggests that nonprofits should first explore AI’s relevance and potential use cases for their own organisation. It is important to provide targeted support to smaller, resource-constrained nonprofits that wish to adopt AI. However, it is also necessary to establish safeguards as the vast majority of those using AI are using technology products managed by others. Understanding the nuances in current AI adoption and knowledge is integral to achieving equitable and beneficial AI adoption for the social sector, says the <em>IDR</em> article.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Apprehensions about AI</strong></h3>



<p>Indian organisations also have some concerns regarding the use of AI. While non-profits were hopeful that AI can bring efficiency and productivity to their work, they also fear that it could lead to dependency, skill gaps, and job displacement.</p>



<p>Respondents were optimistic about the role of AI in facilitating data analysis and decision-making within the organisation. But they were concerned about the lack of knowledge and training with respect to AI, as well as issues around data privacy, security, and bias and fairness. A few non-profits were also worried that AI might impact human creativity and originality. And also apprehensive about the ethical implications of leveraging AI in everyday operations and its broader societal implications.</p>



<p>“The bigger NGOs are more concerned about the use of their data. We do source some data from the<strong> </strong>NGOs but it’s mostly that they have already put out in the public domain,” says Bashir. “The smaller nonprofits are not very concerned about these issues; they are more worried about raising funds as they don’t have exclusive fundraising teams.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ground realities: How some nonprofits are using AI</strong></h2>



<p>Smile Foundation has been using AI in our educational initiatives. <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Mission Education</a>, our flagship programme, has provided education to 200,000 children so far. </p>



<p>To create an enabling learning environment, as part of the initiative the Foundation has improved the infrastructure in their centres by providing green infrastructure &amp; digital classrooms including solar panels, smart class installation, learning software and educational tablets.</p>



<p>“Education technology and digitization of education has given us an opportunity to reimagine the teaching-learning process within the Mission Education initiative,” says Seema Kumar, Deputy Director of Education Programme at Smile Foundation. “Education technology and digitization of education have the potential to transform the way we approach education by enabling personalized learning, expanding access to education, and promoting collaboration and creativity. These will play a crucial role in the future of education, and it will likely continue to evolve and shape the way we teach and learn in the years to come.”</p>



<p>“Application of AI (artificial intelligence) in the areas of personalization of education and experiential learning in the near future will bring exciting outcomes,” says Santanu Mishra, Co-founder &amp; Executive Trustee of Smile Foundation. “Government-corporate-civil society collaboration in the area of education is going to be more synchronized and need-based in the coming days as child education will continue to remain a common cause and one of the national priorities.”</p>



<p>Smile Foundation is also using AI in our healthcare intervention programmes. Two new technology platforms have been integrated in the healthcare programme. ReMeDi, an integrated telemedicine solution, enables teleconsultation where doctors are remotely connected to see patients, talk to them, and access past medical records. The device enables doctors to conduct over 30 point-of-care diagnostic tests in real-time. Results from these tests are transmitted automatically to the EMR. Doctors can prescribe medicines and also refer for follow-up visits and continuous care.</p>



<p><a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1391" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Health</a> Cube, a state-of-art portable diagnostic system, provides results in three to 30 minutes for over 30 tests across various parameters. The system allows smart diagnostics and artificial intelligence to facilitate the rapid screening of patients.</p>

<p>The greatest parenting or educator’s goal is to safeguard and wish the best for one&#8217;s children. At the same time, it is impossible to monitor them continuously, which is also not healthy. Monitoring younger children may be simple; however, as they grow up, they require privacy. Excessive monitoring can damage trust between parents/adults and children.</p>



<p>In today’s time, there is no getting away from online content whether it is for work, studies or socialising. In fact, children with access to technology have seemingly limitless prospects for social interactions, civic engagement, learning, and recreation. This is due to the digital world that is readily available to them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, it makes sense that we help children and young people to be able to differentiate fact from fake at an early age. Ensuring that children use the digital platforms with awareness and have access to credible information can assist in developing a well-rounded perspective on the world. It also safeguards them from hoaxes and frauds.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is misinformation?</strong></h2>



<p>The American Psychological Association defines it as follows: “Misinformation is false or inaccurate information—getting the facts wrong. Disinformation is false information which is deliberately intended to mislead—intentionally misstating the facts.”</p>



<p>Both are widespread on the internet, making it challenging for children to differentiate between real and fake. Kids encounter misinformation in numerous formats, including altered videos, images, articles, links, ads, and pop-ups that encourage clicks. They hear it from influencers and celebrities too. Unfortunately, not all of this content is accurate. For instance, incorrect accounts of history or science can impact their learning. Children are inherently inquisitive but often lack the critical thinking abilities to validate information or even understand the reasons behind misinformation. Social media algorithms function in a manner that often enhances sensational or misleading posts over accurate ones. The influence of peers further complicates the situation, as children might share and trust the information shared within their social circles.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Digital safety</strong> <strong>against false information, misinformation</strong> </h2>



<p>As <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zmvdd6f" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">adults your conversations with children must prioritize digital safety</a>. Let’s take a look at some ways we help children build confidence to figure out what’s fact and what’s fake.</p>



<p><strong>Control the impulse to share immediately</strong></p>



<p>First and foremost, when we see a post online and we experience intense emotions, we should fight against the temptation to share the message right away. Stop, breathe in, and consider if the headline or picture is accurate? Tell the children that headlines can be misleading and they should read the entire article or post before sharing. Sometimes, shocking headlines or pictures can be classic indicators that the post might be phoney.</p>



<p><strong>Check the source</strong></p>



<p>A trustworthy news report will include references for several angles of a problem. Help a child to pinpoint the sources in the story, like the external links in an article. Visit the webpage from where the story originates. Tell them that if they are unsure, then they should see the &#8216;About&#8217; page and read the organizational description. Search for names of the cited individuals as well as the companies supplying the data and numbers. If sources are not shared then it is a big red flag indicating the news report is not credible. Moreover, identify and teach them about the credible sources for news and for their study assignments in your country/region.</p>



<p><strong>Teach children to fact-check stories</strong></p>



<p>Give kids a few simple strategies for determining whether a story might be a prank, a bizarre conspiracy theory, or false facts.&nbsp; Search the title of the post or the article online to see whether the story is already declared as untrue. If it is true news or information, other trustworthy sources most certainly would have covered it. Also, check other news sites you know and rely on. If the news features a picture, look for indications that the image may be a fake. Check for&nbsp;incorrectly positioned shadows? Does it look as though separate images have been glued together? Children can also search the internet for images to see whether the picture has been found to be false. Use a reverse image search that can tell you where it has appeared before, like Google Image Search, RevEye, TinEye, etc.</p>



<p>If an article includes a video, check the creator&#8217;s legitimacy. For stories from organizations or famous people on social media, verify that the account is real, especially if it has a blue tick. Lastly, if something seems too unbelievable or feels wrong, don’t share it.</p>



<p><strong>Admit it if you posted something fake</strong></p>



<p>Encourage your child to take responsibility for their mistakes and reassure them that they needn’t feel embarrassed. Remind them that even adults, including you, have made similar mistakes. If they share information that they later discover is false, they need to communicate this to others. They should do this by posting an update that clarifies the original post was incorrect.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Start today for a better tomorrow </strong></h2>



<p>Teaching children how to evaluate information, and create evidence-based judgements will equip them with lifetime critical thinking and digital literacy abilities that can be applied to their social life, <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2388" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> and relationships. When children can analyze a piece of information—considering its source, intention, and context—they are more equipped to navigate online content effectively.</p>

<p>Parenting is a journey that shapes the personality, behaviour, and future of a child. It influences their emotional, cognitive, and social growth. How parents communicate with their children and the style of parenting they adopt plays an important role in shaping the child’s character as a grown individual. While it is essential to understand how different parenting styles work, there is still a huge gap in the information available and the need for awareness.</p>



<p>Over the last few years, there has been a visible surge in learning about how parenting influences a person&#8217;s life and parents are becoming more conscious of how they treat their children. This growing awareness can be attributed to increased access to information through books, online resources, and expert guidance. Parenting styles refer to the consistent strategies and attitudes that parents use while raising their children.</p>



<p>In this article, we will look at different styles of parenting which may help us in understanding what works best according to the unique needs of our children:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Authoritative Parenting</strong></h3>



<p>This is often considered to be the most balanced parenting style. Parents who adopt this style act as a responsible authority in the child’s life by setting clear expectations and rules while also being nurturing. The hallmark of a good authoritative parenting style is clear communication with the children, providing guidance, and respecting the independence of the child. As per some research findings, children who are raised in this way have better social skills, self-esteem, and academic performance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Authoritarian Parenting</strong></h3>



<p>While authoritative parenting can be confused with a negative style of parenting, it is actually authoritarian parenting which possesses those qualities. It is characterized by strict rules and high expectations. Parents who follow this style are often less responsive to their children&#8217;s emotional needs and prioritize obedience and discipline. Authoritarian parenting can ensure that the children always remain disciplined, but it can severely impact their self-esteem, confidence, and social skills. Authoritarian parents are likely to use strict punishment which can diminish the independent thinking and problem-solving skills of the child.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Permissive Parenting</strong></h3>



<p>Permissive parenting, also known as indulgent parenting, is marked by a lenient and non-directive approach. Parents who practice this style of parenting are nurturing and supportive of the child. However, they fail to set clear expectations and rules. These parents tend to avoid any confrontation and let the children make their own decisions. While permissive parenting can lead to strong parent-child relationships, it may also result in children lacking self-discipline, facing challenges in following rules, and experiencing difficulties in academic performance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Uninvolved Parenting</strong></h3>



<p>This type of parenting is arguably the most harmful for the psychological development of the child. In this type of parenting, the parents are usually absent or uninvolved in the life of their child. Parents who adopt this style provide necessities but offer little guidance, support, or attention. Children raised by uninvolved parents may struggle with self-esteem, academic achievement, and social interactions. These children are also at risk of developing behavioural and psychological disorders as grown-ups.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lighthouse Parenting</strong></h3>



<p>This is a relatively new concept which focuses on guiding the children in a supportive and steady manner without imposing any strict rules. The name comes from the lighthouse which guides the ships to safety. According to an article in the Times of India, lighthouse parents provide a stable and secure environment while allowing their children to explore and make their own choices. Children who are raised in this way are likely to develop resilience, confidence and independence. We can also look at lighthouse parenting as an approach that mixes the authoritative and submissive parenting style providing a balanced approach.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Eggshell Parenting</strong></h3>



<p>In this style of parenting, adults can let their fears takeover how they behave with their kids. Parents become overly cautious about the child to avoid any discomfort. The biggest challenge with this style of parenting is that it can make the children completely dependent on their parents and not being able to develop problem-solving skills. While the intention behind eggshell parenting is to create a harmonious environment, it can hinder a child&#8217;s ability to develop resilience and cope with challenges.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Helicopter Parenting</strong></h3>



<p>This is perhaps completely opposite to uninvolved parenting but can have similar harmful effects for the child. In this style of parenting, the parents become over-involved in the child’s life, monitoring and influencing their every decision. These parents tend to hover over their children, making decisions for them and trying to shield them from any potential harm or failure. While the intention of the parents might be right, they forget that it is important for the children to make mistakes and learn from them. Helicopter parenting takes away this opportunity and the children are not able to make decisions when they are left without someone who can do it for them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Impact of Parenting Style on Children</strong></h2>



<p>As discussed above, every parenting style can have some positive or negative effects on the children. It must also be understood that parents are not likely to follow a particular parenting style all the time. Similarly, both the parents may also have different parenting styles. Therefore, the readers must not treat this article as a diagnosis for their parenting style and approach a qualified practitioner in case they want to make changes to their parenting style.</p>



<p>Here are some ways in which children are impacted by parenting styles:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Emotional development:</strong> As it can be understood from what we have discussed above, how a child is raised can have a direct impact on their emotional maturity. Whether children experience higher or lower anxiety and stress, and what kind of other emotional traits they will develop depends a lot on what their relationship with their parents is.</li>



<li><strong>Social skills: </strong>Imagine a child being raised by an overly critical parent who adopts the helicopter style. This child is likely to be criticized for most of the things that they do. This can have a severe impact on their confidence and how they perform in social situations where they have to act independently. This is just one example of how parenting styles can influence an individual’s social skills.</li>



<li><strong>Academic performance:</strong> A child who is raised in a healthy household with supportive parents is likely to perform better academically. While it is not necessary that every child will be an academic genius if they have the right parenting; one thing is sure that they will have the support of their parents to pursue what they are actually good at.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What can Parents Learn?</strong></h2>



<p>Understanding different parenting styles and their impact on children&#8217;s development can help parents make informed decisions about their approach to parenting. It is important to recognize that no single parenting style is universally applicable, and each child is unique. Parents should consider their child&#8217;s temperament, needs, and preferences when determining the most effective parenting style.</p>



<p>Parents should also put special focus on understanding their child’s unique requirements and adopt an integrated approach where they use different styles in different situations. For example, combining the structure and support of authoritative parenting with the nurturing and flexibility of permissive parenting can create a harmonious and effective parenting strategy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Parenting can be extremely challenging and knowing that it can have lifelong impact on the child makes it even more difficult. Additionally, with the all-pervasive presence of technology, access to all kinds of information, new forms of digital addiction, and perils of growing up in a social media driven world makes it even more difficult for parents to understand how they can develop a healthy relationship with their children. This has also put a focus on parenting styles and how parents can balance the high expectations while also providing necessary support to the child.</p>



<p>As parents deal with these challenges, a strong awareness of parenting styles and strategies can help them in following an approach that works the best for their children. Ultimately, the goal of parenting is to raise confident, resilient, and well-adjusted individuals who can thrive in the world. As you reflect on your own parenting style, consider the insights gained from this article and how you can apply them to support your child&#8217;s growth and well-being. What kind of parenting style do you follow, and what can you learn from the different approaches discussed here?</p>

<p>2024 was a difficult year, more so because of the escalating conflicts and the consequences of climate-change. With tons of losses– both human and environment, nonprofits all across the world called for peace, stability and urgent action. Smile Foundation, focusing on scaling its interventions, renewed long-standing partnerships and curated special projects with our new partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our work, however, also extends to addressing critical global issues through advocacy and action. In line with this, the<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow"><strong>Smile Blog</strong></a> gained substantial traction in 2024, reaching almost half a million readers. This year, some blog posts stood out in their relevance and impact. Here, we take a closer look at the top 10 blogs that resonated the most with our readers.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/more-women-join-stem-courses-few-make-it-to-the-top/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">More Women Join STEM Courses, Few Make it to the Top</a></li>
</ol>



<p>The underrepresentation of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields is a pressing issue impeding progress and innovation. Despite women constituting 43% of STEM graduates in India, their participation in the STEM workforce remains disproportionately low, with only 14% securing related jobs.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdJOqgu-eZXnpwcSHFmcbDEnQh6ar209xZBYrt1IVcKmegSQXnWZ7H5GYUxF8I_WAmbWqNarcHUV-TDNcMr13GyNHaMioOoWMl1oio2SsGwoTmPyYoZC8VuehKcV9JAutZDOMho?key=Ei_0JS7yF7X9ZWxUZqDMvj2n" alt=""/></figure>



<p>By highlighting the challenges and advocating for increased female participation, Smile Foundation seeks to inspire systemic change, ensuring that women have equal opportunities to contribute to and benefit from STEM industries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/strengthening-primary-healthcare-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Strengthening Primary Healthcare in India</a></li>
</ol>



<p>Access to quality primary healthcare is a cornerstone of a nation&#8217;s well-being, directly influencing educational outcomes, economic productivity, and overall quality of life. In India, challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, workforce shortages, and urban-rural disparities roadblock the effective delivery of primary healthcare services.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdIKJfcQEO6TEZ89qkMjPDZgYMpS2aZhc0LyjwIHeHpYN8R6RP7bMnWBsqaXDHUNjaGka42kdlhaKUXSyXeILkCAGmL2Aq71P7WQQaEwy5yZHO7lvd0JsmjAe-spYLyvr7W1ocQkw?key=Ei_0JS7yF7X9ZWxUZqDMvj2n" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Through this blog, we shed light on the critical importance of strengthening primary healthcare systems and advocate for increased investment and policy focus in this area to ensure equitable access for all.</p>



<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/vocational-education-helps-decrease-unemployment-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Vocational Education Helps Decrease Unemployment in India</a></li>
</ol>



<p>We chose to address the persistent issue of unemployment among India&#8217;s educated youth because it remains a significant concern, despite recent declines in overall unemployment rates. Notably, the unemployment rate for graduates was 29.1%, almost nine times higher than the 3.4% for those who can&#8217;t read or write.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This paradox, where higher <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2379" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> does not necessarily lead to better employment prospects, highlights a critical disconnect between academic curricula and industry requirements. By exploring this topic, we highlighted the potential of vocational education as a practical solution to bridge this gap. Vocational training has been shown to significantly enhance employability, with 70% of trained individuals securing employment compared to 50% of untrained individuals.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="400" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/admin-ajax.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-10135" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/admin-ajax.webp 600w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/admin-ajax-300x200.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<p>Our goal is to encourage a shift in perception towards vocational education, emphasizing its role in equipping youth with industry-relevant skills and improving their employment prospects.</p>



<ol start="4" class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/building-sustainability-into-ngo-initiatives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Building Sustainability into NGO Initiatives</a></li>
</ol>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="400" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/admin-ajax.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10136" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/admin-ajax.jpg 600w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/admin-ajax-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<p>While the efforts of development organisations often lead to immediate, visible improvements, ensuring that these positive changes endure over time remains a significant challenge. Integrating sustainability into our initiatives is no longer optional but important for creating lasting impact.</p>



<p>By focusing on sustainability, nonprofits can develop programmes that not only meet present needs but also sustain into future generations. This approach aligns with the United Nations&#8217; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), providing a clear framework for achieving equitable and resilient development. Through strategic planning, community engagement, and collaborative partnerships, we can increase the longevity of our initiatives for enduring positive change.</p>



<ol start="5" class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/the-status-of-women-entrepreneurship-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">The Status of Women Entrepreneurship in India</a></li>
</ol>



<p>Did you know that women&#8217;s economic contribution in India is just 17% of the GDP, way below the global average of 40%? That&#8217;s a huge gap!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="400" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/admin-ajax-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10137" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/admin-ajax-1.jpg 600w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/admin-ajax-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<p>Traditionally, our society has viewed men as the primary leaders and providers, especially in the corporate world. This mindset has often sidelined women from top positions. But here&#8217;s some good news: recent reports show a positive shift. Women-led startups in India have grown from 10% to 18% between 2017 and 2021. Plus, in 2022, 17% of unicorn startups had women at the helm, up from 8% in 2017. And guess what? These startups are attracting more investor interest, securing 20% of the total funding in 2022.</p>



<p>Sounds promising, right? But let&#8217;s dig deeper. Despite these encouraging numbers, many women entrepreneurs still face daily challenges. In our blog, we discussed those challenges of women entrepreneurs in our country.</p>



<ol start="6" class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/steam-education-the-new-educational-landscape-for-rural-india/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">STEAM Education- The New Educational Landscape for Rural India</a> </li>
</ol>



<p>In rural India, where resources are often limited, introducing STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) education can be a game-changer. Through our Mission Education initiative, we have witnessed firsthand the positive impact of integrating STEAM learning into the curriculum. By conducting interactive workshops and providing training materials, we promote collaboration and exploratory learning among students, enabling them to improve their problem-solving skills and creativity.&nbsp; Sharing our experiences and insights on this topic allows us to advocate for the expansion of STEAM education across rural India.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="400" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/admin-ajax-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10138" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/admin-ajax-2.jpg 600w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/admin-ajax-2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<ol start="7" class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/how-does-menstrual-leave-help-women-manage-their-lives-better/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">How does Menstrual Leave help Women Manage their Lives Better?</a></li>
</ol>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="401" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/admin-ajax-3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10139" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/admin-ajax-3.jpg 600w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/admin-ajax-3-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<p>The blog was written to highlight the challenges faced by women, especially those from small towns, who venture out for work in urban settings. Seema&#8217;s story reflects the resilience and determination of first-generation women in professional spaces but also discusses the stress that comes with balancing multiple responsibilities and tight deadlines. The need for this topic arose from the increasing number of women like Seema, who are trying to navigate the pressures of career success while managing mental and emotional well-being, urging a discussion on work-life balance and support systems for women in the workforce.</p>



<ol start="8" class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/extreme-heat-threatens-education-and-health-of-children-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Extreme Heat Threatens Education and Health of Children in India</a></li>
</ol>



<p>Extreme heat, fueled by climate change, is forcing children in many Asia-Pacific countries out of classrooms and impacting their education and <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1385" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a>. Countries like India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and the Philippines are experiencing increasingly dangerous heatwaves, putting their most vulnerable populations at risk. The need to address this issue is urgent, as children, especially in low-resourced areas, are facing higher temperatures without adequate infrastructure to safeguard their well-being. This conversation calls for collective action to ensure that children can continue learning in safe environments despite extreme heat.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="400" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/admin-ajax-4.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10140" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/admin-ajax-4.jpg 600w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/admin-ajax-4-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<p>We emphasise the intersection of climate change, health, and education, encouraging governments, school authorities, and communities to invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, adjust school schedules, and promote health education. As many countries face rapid demographic changes, this blog highlights the importance of protecting children’s futures by safeguarding their health and academic opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="9" class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/what-happens-when-girls-are-stopped-from-going-to-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">What Happens When Girls are Stopped from Going to Schools?</a></li>
</ol>



<p>Reaffirming the critical importance of girl child education, particularly in regions where girls are denied access to schooling due to deep-rooted societal barriers and adversity, this piece positions education as undeniably a powerful tool for empowerment. The urgency of this issue is highlighted by the stark statistics that show the global disparities in access to education for girls, particularly in conflict zones, impoverished areas, and conservative societies.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="400" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/admin-ajax-5-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10142" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/admin-ajax-5-1.jpg 600w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/admin-ajax-5-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<p>The need to address this topic is ever-present, as data repeatedly demonstrates that investing in female education has wide-ranging positive effects. Educated women and girls contribute to healthier families, reduced poverty, and better economic opportunities. However, many continue to face systemic challenges like early marriage, gender violence, and unsafe learning environments.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="10" class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/imbibing-a-culture-of-empathy-through-employee-giving/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Imbibing a Culture of Empathy through Employee Giving</a></li>
</ol>



<p>By linking employees to meaningful causes, businesses can amplify their social responsibility while encouraging personal growth and positive societal change.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="450" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/admin-ajax-6.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10143" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/admin-ajax-6.jpg 600w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/admin-ajax-6-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<p>The need for this topic is especially important as companies are increasingly aware of their roles in driving social change and fulfilling Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) objectives. Employee Giving not only creates a sense of unity within the workplace but also serves as a bridge between financial goals and social impact. By leveraging opportunities such as tax exemptions and direct contributions to initiatives like child education, women empowerment, and healthcare access, companies can significantly enhance their <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" title="Corporate Partnerships" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="395" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">CSR</a> footprint, while employees feel a stronger connection to the causes they care about.</p>



<p>These top 10 blogs exemplify our ongoing commitment to raising awareness and driving action on social issues that need intention and action. The next year, Smile Foundation will continue to prioritise topics that reflect both current challenges and long-term solutions, with a focus on creating lasting change.</p>
