										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you grew up in northern India, chances are you’ve heard the saying <em>Padhoge Likhoge Banoge Nawab </em>(study hard and you’ll go far in life). It’s one of those timeless proverbs that families pass down, a reminder of how deeply education is valued in our culture. The phrase became even more popular after Asha Bhosale sang it in the 1958 film <em><strong>Malik</strong></em>. Back then, just a decade after independence, this wasn’t just a catchy line – it echoed a national belief that <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2650" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> ( a means for good employability) wasn’t just good for the individual, it was essential for building the future of the country.</p>



<p>In a newly sovereign India grappling with poverty, illiteracy, and social fragmentation, this proverb encapsulated a powerful aspiration. It signified hope for millions, who saw education as the primary vehicle for socioeconomic transformation. The imagery of the nawab as in the phrase was not literal but symbolic – it represented dignity, status and participation in the democratic promise of postcolonial India. The assumption was that an educated populace would serve as the vanguard of progress and modernity.</p>



<p>But today, that hopeful vision needs a closer look. Sure, more kids are in school than ever before, but just getting an education isn’t always enough. The big question now is: are we preparing young people for real jobs and real opportunities? For many, the link between schooling and a meaningful livelihood still feels weak. It’s time to rethink what we’re teaching, how we’re teaching it, and whether it’s truly setting students up for success.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-addressing-the-massive-gap"><strong>Addressing the massive gap</strong></h2>



<p>Here’s the tough reality: in India today, getting a degree doesn’t always lead to a job. In fact, more education can sometimes mean fewer chances at employment. Sounds backwards, but the numbers say it all. According to Azim Premji University’s <a href="https://azimpremjiuniversity.edu.in/the-indian-economy/state-of-working-india-2023" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><em>State of Working India 2023</em> </a>report, nearly <strong>43% of graduates under 25</strong> are unemployed. That’s twice the rate of those who stopped at secondary school. Some states are seeing this gap even more sharply with Andhra Pradesh having more than 35% of graduates jobless in late 2022. Even more telling is that the graduates made up a whopping 73% of the state’s total unemployed. It’s a worrying sign that our education system isn’t connecting with the job market, and young people are paying the price.</p>



<p>You can really see this disconnect playing out in real life. In Uttar Pradesh, government job openings for low-skill roles, like messengers or railway porters, which need only a 5th or 10th-grade education recently saw <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/railways-jobs-jobs-in-railways-indian-railways-had-63-000-job-openings-19-million-people-applied-1974696" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">hundreds of thousands of applicants</a>. But the catch is many of them were postgraduates, MBAs, even PhDs. When highly educated people line up for jobs that don’t need those qualifications, it’s a clear sign that something’s broken. The deeper issue is whether our education system is preparing people for the kind of work that actually exists or not.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-recognising-impediments-in-the-process-of-employability"><strong>Recognising impediments in the process of employability </strong></h2>



<p>According to the <strong><a href="https://resources.mettl.com/research/india-graduate-skill-index-2025/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Mercer-Mettl Graduate Skill Index 2025</a></strong>, only 42.6% of Indian graduates are considered employable, down from 44.3% in 2023. It&#8217;s a worrying trend that reflects a growing disconnect between education and what the job market actually needs.</p>



<p>A big part of the problem is the way many universities still operate. Rote learning and outdated syllabi leave little room for building relevant skills. Students rarely get to work with technologies that are reshaping the world of work like artificial intelligence, data analytics, cloud computing or cybersecurity. They earn degrees, but not necessarily the capabilities that help them thrive at work.</p>



<p>Practical experience is often missing too. Internships, live projects and apprenticeships are still not mainstream in higher education. This means graduates often step into the workforce without ever having worked in a real-world setting. On top of that, soft skills like communication, critical thinking and teamwork don’t get the attention they deserve.</p>



<p>The employability gap widens further when you consider regional disparities, gender gaps and the slow rate of job creation. For many young people, especially in underserved areas, it’s about access and opportunity.</p>



<p>To change this, we need much closer collaboration between industry and academia. Course design should involve employers. Students need hands-on learning built into their programmes. And soft skills training should be as essential as technical knowledge. We also need to explore new approaches that respond to fast-changing market needs and help young people build their own paths – whether that’s in jobs or entrepreneurship.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-real-world-solutions-for-more-employability-in-india"><strong>Building real world solutions</strong> <strong>for more employability in India</strong></h2>



<p>The growing gap between college degrees and job readiness can’t be ignored. While government-led skilling schemes and education reforms are an important part of the solution, they aren’t enough on their own. What’s needed is a more collaborative approach, one that brings in civil society, NGOs and community-based organisations that work directly with young people, especially those from underserved backgrounds.</p>



<p>Take Smile Foundation’s <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">STeP (Smile Twin e-Learning Programme)</a>, for example. It’s designed to equip young people with both the technical and soft skills they need to get into the workforce. Beyond training, STeP also offers career counselling to help participants make informed, realistic choices about their future.</p>



<p>Between 2023 and 2024, over 9,000 young people were trained through the STeP programme. Of these, 550 went on to secure jobs across a range of industries. We also conducted more than 800 career counselling sessions and organised multiple industry exposure visits, giving participants a real sense of what different workplaces are like.</p>



<p>Support doesn’t end once someone completes the training or gets placed. STeP offers continued guidance – from confidence-building and interview prep to post-placement support so that young people feel equipped to stay and grow in the jobs they land.</p>



<p>Initiatives like this show that employability is also about helping young people build aspirations, understand their options and connect to opportunities that often lie just out of reach.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>India’s booming gig economy offers flexibility and opportunity, but millions of blue-collar workers remain trapped in low-paying, unstable roles due to limited skills and support. Smile Foundation’s upskilling initiatives focus on equipping these workers with digital literacy, vocational training, financial awareness, and life skills. By addressing underemployment at the grassroots level, these programmes help unlock economic mobility, improve livelihoods, and create a future-ready workforce that fuels inclusive growth across sectors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>India’s economic story is often told through the lens of innovation, startup growth, and digital disruption. But behind this dominant narrative lies the fact that millions of working Indians are underemployed, not unemployed. According to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, India’s underemployment score stands at 62.28, even though official unemployment remains below 7 percent.</p>



<p>The distinction matters. While unemployment refers to those without jobs, underemployment captures those working below their skill level or in insecure, low-paying roles. A large portion of these workers belong to India’s informal or gig economy. They drive cabs, deliver groceries, repair appliances, or assist in homes and hospitals. They are essential to daily urban life, but remain invisible in policy conversations. Without intervention, they risk being left behind in an economy that is moving faster than their ability to catch up.</p>



<p>The solution lies in reimagining <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" title="Livelihood" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2611" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">skill development</a>, especially for blue-collar gig workers. This is not about formal degrees or certificates, but about equipping people with the tools they need to succeed in the real economy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gig-economy-a-growing-workforce-with-shrinking-opportunities"><strong>Gig economy: A growing workforce with shrinking opportunities</strong></h2>



<p>India’s gig economy is expanding rapidly. Reports estimate that gig work could contribute up to <strong>1.25 percent of India’s GDP by 2030</strong>. Platform-based jobs now stretch across services from delivery and ride-hailing to beauty, domestic care and field tech support.</p>



<p>Yet most of these roles sit at the bottom of the value chain. They are transactional, poorly paid, and offer little upward mobility. More than 90 percent of India’s workforce is informally employed, and within that, a significant share are blue-collar gig workers with little to no social security.</p>



<p>A Bain &amp; Company study notes that only 12 percent of gig workers use platforms to grow their earnings or build businesses. A staggering 35 percent are financially strapped day labourers who survive on daily wages, making them particularly vulnerable to inflation, illness, or platform shutdowns.</p>



<p>The skills gap explains much of this stagnation. Gig work today is no longer just physical—it is digital and customer-facing. A delivery worker needs to manage orders through apps, handle cashless payments, communicate with customers and navigate real-time changes. These are not intuitive tasks, especially for first-time earners from rural or low-income urban households.</p>



<p>The problem is not a lack of aspiration. Most of these workers seek better lives, more stable incomes, and opportunities to grow. What they lack is access to the kind of skilling that prepares them for the future of work.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-limitations-of-current-skilling-programmes"><strong>The limitations of current skilling programmes</strong></h2>



<p>India has made considerable investments in skilling through schemes like <a href="https://skillindiamission.in/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Skill India Mission</a> and <a href="https://www.india.gov.in/pradhan-mantri-kaushal-vikas-yojana-pmkvy" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">PMKVY</a>. These programmes have helped formalise vocational training across sectors. But for gig workers, especially blue-collar ones, most skilling options remain out of reach.</p>



<p>First, traditional training centres often operate on fixed schedules and at fixed locations. Gig workers, with unpredictable shifts and long hours, cannot easily attend. Second, many programmes still teach generic skills like tailoring, data entry, beauty services without linking them to current market demand or platform-specific roles. Third, most workers receive little support after training. Placement services, mentorship, and access to finance are rarely integrated into the training lifecycle.</p>



<p>There is also a gender gap. Women in gig work, particularly in domestic or care roles, are rarely targeted for upskilling despite growing demand in <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2610" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> and home-based services. Digital safety, mobility constraints, and childcare responsibilities make it harder for them to access training.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-skilling-that-meets-workers-where-they-are"><strong>Skilling that meets workers where they are</strong></h2>



<p>For skill development to truly empower India’s gig workforce, it needs to adapt to the realities of blue-collar work. This means making training modular, mobile, vernacular, and hyper-local.</p>



<p>An effective skilling model for gig workers should include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Hands-on vocational training</strong> that mirrors real-world tasks</li>



<li><strong>Soft skills and life skills</strong> like communication, time management, and customer interaction</li>



<li><strong>Basic digital literacy</strong> to help navigate apps and online platforms</li>



<li><strong>Financial literacy</strong> to improve savings, budgeting, and credit access</li>



<li><strong>Entrepreneurial skills</strong> for those who want to build micro-enterprises or transition out of platform dependency</li>
</ul>



<p>These elements are not optional. They form the foundation of a future-ready, inclusive workforce that can adapt as platforms evolve and new jobs emerge.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smile-foundation-s-skilling-model-linking-training-to-livelihoods"><strong>Smile Foundation’s skilling model: Linking training to livelihoods</strong></h2>



<p>Smile Foundation’s work in the area of employability offers valuable insights into how blue-collar workers can be prepared for a modern economy. Through our <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Smile Twin e-Learning Programme (STeP)</a>, we provide market-linked training to youth aged 18 to 32 from underserved backgrounds. The curriculum focuses on retail, hospitality, logistics, beauty, and wellness—sectors where gig work is concentrated.</p>



<p>What sets STeP apart is its emphasis on end-to-end support. Participants are trained not just in job-specific skills but also in communication, basic English, financial literacy, and digital tools. The programme also partners with over 200 companies to ensure placement opportunities after training.</p>



<p>In 2023–24, more than 12,000 youth completed training through STeP. Of those, around 72 percent secured jobs in sectors aligned with their training, many in gig and service roles. The programme operates in 25 states, with a special focus on rural and tier-2 regions where formal skilling infrastructure is limited.</p>



<p>Beyond STeP, Smile Foundation collaborates with companies through <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" title="Corporate Partnerships" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2612" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">CSR</a> partnerships to reach larger numbers of gig workers. These partnerships fund mobile skilling vans, doorstep training and digital courses. This convergence of civil society implementation with corporate investment can accelerate change on the ground.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-corporate-engagement-not-just-good-csr-but-good-business"><strong>Corporate engagement: Not just good CSR, but good business</strong></h2>



<p>The private sector has a critical role to play in building a robust, inclusive gig economy. Better-skilled workers lead to better service delivery, improved customer satisfaction, and brand trust. In a competitive platform economy, quality, and reliability are key differentiators. Companies like Urban Company, Zomato, and Amazon are already experimenting with in-house training modules and health coverage for gig workers.</p>



<p>Others, like Quess Corp and Tata STRIVE, are running placement-linked skilling programmes that bridge the supply-demand gap in blue-collar services. Platforms that invest in upskilling their workers tend to have lower attrition and better ratings—benefits that directly affect their bottom line.</p>



<p>Government incentives could further encourage such investments. For example, public-private partnerships could tie skilling outcomes to tax credits or regulatory benefits. Micro-credentials co-designed by platforms and skilling partners can provide gig workers with verified, portable skills that enhance employability across platforms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-needs-to-happen-next-for-the-gig-economy"><strong>What needs to happen next</strong> <strong>for the gig economy</strong></h2>



<p>India’s demographic dividend will only pay off if its working-age population has the skills to meet 21st-century demands. For the blue-collar gig workforce, this requires a new approach that is agile, inclusive, and outcome-focused.</p>



<p>Here is what policymakers, nonprofits and corporate leaders can do:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Map sectoral needs</strong>: Regularly update demand forecasts for gig sectors and tailor skilling programmes accordingly.</li>



<li><strong>Encourage digital skilling</strong>: Make short-form, mobile-first learning content available in multiple Indian languages.</li>



<li><strong>Target women workers</strong>: Design training that includes mobility support, childcare solutions, and safe working conditions.</li>



<li><strong>Link training to finance</strong>: Combine skilling with access to microcredit, insurance and savings products.</li>



<li><strong>Certify and recognise skills</strong>: Create micro-credential systems that allow workers to build and stack skills over time.</li>



<li><strong>Strengthen local ecosystems</strong>: Build partnerships between municipalities, industry, and nonprofits to ensure local implementation and accountability.</li>
</ol>



<p>These steps require collaboration, not duplication. Skilling cannot succeed in silos. It must be embedded into public policy, supported by private innovation and delivered through grassroots networks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-looking-ahead-from-labour-to-leverage"><strong>Looking ahead: From labour to leverage</strong></h2>



<p>India’s gig economy is here to stay. It represents an opportunity to make the labour market more flexible, more inclusive, and more resilient. But without a concerted focus on upskilling, it could also deepen existing inequalities.</p>



<p>Blue-collar gig workers are not just labourers. They are caregivers, problem-solvers, and digital citizens in the making. When we invest in their growth, we invest in the very infrastructure that keeps our cities moving and our economy running.</p>



<p>A delivery worker today could become a team leader tomorrow, a home services provider could become a franchise owner, a ride-hailing driver could transition to fleet management. All this is possible if the right skills meet the right opportunity.</p>



<p>As India builds its future of work, the question is not whether gig work will grow, but whether gig workers will grow with it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nowadays, India is witnessing a growing shift towards a skills-first economy,  where an educational degree alone is not enough to secure a job. With digitisation and technological advances in every sphere of life, more and more employers and hiring managers are looking for youth with fundamental, hands-on skills that can be used on the job from the beginning. Whether coding, digital marketing, technology, design, technical adaptability, and so on, practical skills matter more than traditional academic qualifications.<br><br>A recent survey by Indeed, a job-hunting portal, shows that 80% of Indian employers prefer hiring based on skills and experience to educational degrees alone. This shift comes as industries face fast-paced tech changes and newer business needs. Companies want people who can hit the ground running, and to reiterate, that means practical know-how is becoming more valuable than ever.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why is skill-based hiring becoming so important?</strong></h2>



<p>Most jobs today require a practical understanding of the work and industry demand—something vocational and skills training may provide over theory-based learning. This is further motivated by the need to keep upskilling oneself to meet the needs of tech-driven workplaces.<br><br>With a growing startup ecosystem, changing business models, and a young workforce, employers focus more on what candidates can do with their skills training than what they’ve studied on paper. This shift is helping bridge the gap between <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2467" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> and employment, helping more startups create employment opportunities.<br><br>Further, data shows how skill-based hiring promotes equity and inclusion by evaluating candidates on competencies, not education. According to the 2025 Human Progress Report by ETS, 65 percent of Indian workers believe that skills-first hiring can eliminate discrimination and make India’s job market more equitable. This also creates a space for diverse groups frequently left out of the job market, which once solely prioritised academics over practical skills. It is widely believed that in a country like India, where the urban-rural divide runs deep, many individuals seeking to re-enter the workforce, often in remote or part-time roles, will benefit from this approach. For example, during the pandemic, many women took online courses in digital marketing, content creation, and IT services while balancing home responsibilities to seek employment.<br><br>However, this shift in the workforce also calls for a paradigmatic change in the education sector: how we impart education and skill training to the youth to ensure economic mobility.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>STEM learning is the way forward</strong></h2>



<p>In 2015, the Prime Minister of India launched the ‘Skill India’ programme, which focuses on ‘Kaushal Bharat, Kushal Bharat’.The programme envisions upskilling and training the young population to transform India into the largest manpower supplier in the world. The recent data suggests India is projected to send over 1,00,000 STEM students to the United States by 2026, reflecting a substantial rise in the country&#8217;s contribution to global talent pools. This implies that the job market now demands skill-based talent, and India is fulfilling the same.<br><br>Understanding the need to bridge this gap between education and industry demands, <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Smile Foundation</a>, through its STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) programme, has been working to empower underprivileged students nationwide by providing hands-on learning experiences. Collaborating with partners like BMW India Foundation and Shell, Smile Foundation has established state-of-the-art STEM labs in government and community schools and mobile labs equipped with solar-powered kits and robotic models. These initiatives aim to engage over 2,500 students annually, fostering creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills among young learners. Additionally, the program includes workshops, innovation challenges, and teacher training to ensure sustainable and impactful STEM education.<br><br>In addition, through another initiative, the <a href="http://Whether coding, digital marketing, technology, design, technical adaptability, and so on, practical know-how matters more than traditional academic qualifications." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Smile Twin e-Learning Programme (STeP)</a>, Smile offers comprehensive skills training that combines academic learning with practical skills. These programmes enhance core employability skills such as communication, problem-solving, digital literacy, teamwork, and industry-specific retail and digital marketing training. By 2020, over 34,000 youth were trained, and over 20,000 students were placed under the programme. This holistic approach empowers youth, particularly from underserved communities, to achieve economic independence.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Synergy between education and skills&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>While skills-based jobs have pushed India towards many advancements, the country faces a unique challenge: many graduates but insufficient skills to fill high-demand jobs. Despite many young people entering the workforce each year, businesses struggle to find the right talent, particularly in technical roles.</p>



<p>The root cause is our traditional educational system, which continues to emphasise rote learning, memorisation, and theory-based exams over practical, job-ready abilities. According to a report, over 80 per cent of Indian engineers are unfit for jobs in the economy due to a lack of new-age skills.<br><br>To address this growing gap, India needs to reevaluate its educational system. The answer is obvious: a modern curriculum emphasising practical skills, projects, and a close relationship to industry demands. This approach can assist students in bridging the gap between their college coursework and what employers are looking for in the real world.</p>



<p>In the coming days, the success of modern educational institutions will lie in focusing on skills rather than just exams, to solve India&#8217;s job crisis. Moving away from outdated learning methods can make a big difference, like:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Reducing unemployment:</strong> When schools align their curriculum with what industries need, students graduate with job-ready skills, helping to close the gap between job openings and qualified candidates.</li>



<li><strong>Encouraging innovation:</strong> Imbibing critical analysis classes and engaging students in critical thinking can help build skills to solve real-world problems. This helps create a culture of creativity and entrepreneurship, boosting India&#8217;s economy.</li>



<li><strong>Preparing for global careers:</strong> India has a massive pool of talented students. With proper tech-based education and classroom teaching, students can compete globally at leading tech firms or by building their own startups.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Partnership plays its key role</strong></h2>



<p>A modern, skills-first curriculum must become the norm to unlock the full potential of India’s young workforce. This requires strong partnerships between schools, the government, and industries. Some key steps include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Partnering with tech companies:</strong> Schools should work with tech firms to create up-to-date curricula that match current job market demands.</li>



<li><strong>Government support:</strong> Grants and rewards should be given to institutions prioritising skill-based education to encourage wider adoption.</li>



<li><strong>Expanding to rural areas: </strong>Skills-based, tech-driven education should be made accessible in rural regions, where students have often been left out of major education reforms.</li>
</ul>



<p>Through our skills programme, Smile Foundation connects youth from disadvantaged groups and communities with sectors with considerable growth potential and employability. The staggering youth population underutilised in the job market because of a lack of requisite qualifications and training are upskilled, uplifted, and mainstreamed to become a part of the country’s growth story. The initiative aims to complement the government’s vision and efforts under the Skill India mission, and is aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals 4 and 8. In the last financial year, 9,000 youth were trained, 5500 were placed under this programme, with 96% of enrollees qualifying to receive the STeP certification</p>



<p>Further, as part of <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" title="Corporate Partnerships" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="409" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">CSR</a> activities, Smile has joined hands with Berger Paints to initiate their iTrain on Wheels programme, aimed at enhancing the painting skills of local painters. This project aims to provide painters across India with specialised training in various techniques, empowering them for more diverse employment opportunities and elevating their overall quality of life. iTrain on Wheels is a platform for painters to acquire new skills and improve their existing ones.<br><br>With components of spoken English, financial literacy, basic computers, personality development, and industry visits, we believe in nurturing young minds and improving livelihoods by aligning training with industry needs and facilitating job placements.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The future of India will not be decided in boardrooms or election rallies. It will be decided in skilling centres, job training workshops, and classrooms tucked away in India&#8217;s towns and villages.</p>



<p>Because by 2047 — when India celebrates a century of independence — we will have <strong>1.1 billion</strong> people in the working-age group. <strong>One billion dreams</strong> and just two short decades to prepare.</p>



<p>Yet, as it stands, the majority of Indian youth are woefully unprepared for the economy that awaits them. Without urgent, sweeping action, India risks turning its greatest asset — its demographic dividend — into a demographic disaster.</p>



<p>Smile Foundation’s livelihood programme,&nbsp;<strong>STeP (Smile Twin e-Learning Programme)</strong>, is not just a training intervention. It is a rescue operation for a generation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>India’s demographic ticking clock</strong></h2>



<p>India’s demographic dividend window opened in 2005-06 and will last till the mid-2050s. The clock is ticking. We have the numbers: a young, energetic, ambitious workforce. But numbers mean nothing without skills.</p>



<p>Today, only&nbsp;<strong>4.7%</strong>&nbsp;of India&#8217;s workforce has received formal vocational training, compared to&nbsp;<strong>75%</strong>&nbsp;in Germany and&nbsp;<strong>68%</strong>in the United Kingdom (India Skills Report 2024). This is not a gap. It is a chasm.</p>



<p>For the millions of unemployed and underemployed youth in India’s villages and cities, the lack of relevant skills is a silent epidemic that is stealing futures, eroding dignity, and threatening the very idea of economic mobility.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Skilling India must meet reality, not just policy</strong></h2>



<p>While government initiatives like Skill India, Digital India, and Make in India are important, they are not enough unless they translate into real, market-relevant skills at the grassroots.</p>



<p>Smile Foundation’s <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">livelihood</a> programme does exactly that.<br>It meets the youth where they are, not where policy documents assume them to be.</p>



<p>So far, the programme has:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Trained over 9,000 youth</strong> across 8 states</li>



<li><strong>Placed over 5,500 youth</strong> in sustainable jobs</li>



<li><strong>Established 74 skilling centres</strong> specializing in sectors with high growth potential</li>
</ul>



<p>And it does this not through theory, but through practice — connecting youth with <strong>over 400 employment partners</strong> like Sodexo, Concentrix,Tata Trent, and more.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Skilling for the economy of today and tomorrow</strong></h3>



<p>The Smile Foundation skilling model is built around real industry needs:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Core Employability (21st Century Skills):</strong> Communication, teamwork, problem-solving — the basic currencies of any workplace.</li>



<li><strong>Healthcare (General Duty Assistance):</strong> Preparing youth for India’s growing healthcare sector.</li>



<li><strong>BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance):</strong> Tapping into the formal finance sector.</li>



<li><strong>Digital Marketing:</strong> Training youth for jobs that didn’t even exist a decade ago.</li>
</ul>



<p>This is not skilling for skilling’s sake but for survival and leadership.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why livelihood is the new literacy</strong></h2>



<p>In a country where digital payments grew by&nbsp;<strong>50% year-on-year in 2023</strong>, not teaching digital literacy is equivalent to not teaching literacy at all.</p>



<p>Smile Foundation has embedded <strong>dynamic e-learning platforms</strong> — videos, quizzes, interactive simulations — into its courses.<br>Training has gone paperless — not just for sustainability, but for efficiency and scale.</p>



<p>Because future jobs won&#8217;t ask for a paper certificate. They will ask for skills that are adaptable, digital, and durable.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Partnerships that build pathways, not dead-ends</strong></h2>



<p>One reason many skilling programmes fail is because they stop at the classroom door. Smile Foundation does not.</p>



<p>Through partnerships with:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>NIIT Foundation</strong></li>



<li><strong>Tata Strive</strong></li>



<li><strong>Wadhwani Foundation</strong></li>



<li><strong>IT-ITeS Sector Skills Council</strong></li>



<li><strong>NSDC certification</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Smile Foundation ensures that training translates into recognized, respected credentials. Trainees are prepared not just to find jobs, but to build careers.</p>



<p>Through <strong>800+ career counselling sessions</strong>, young people are equipped to make informed choices — a critical factor in long-term employment success.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reaching the invisible workforce: Painters on wheels</strong></h3>



<p>One of the most inspired initiatives has been the&nbsp;<strong>iTrain on Wheels</strong>&nbsp;programme, a collaboration with&nbsp;<strong>Berger Paints India Ltd</strong>.</p>



<p>Over <strong>1,18,000 painters</strong> across <strong>25 states</strong> have been upskilled — trained not just in modern techniques, but in entrepreneurship.<br>Because painters are not just workers. They are potential business owners, franchise creators, community employers.</p>



<p>In an informal economy that often traps workers in cycles of low-skill, low-wage labor, this programme offers real economic mobility.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why industry exposure is non-negotiable</strong> <strong>for skilling India</strong></h2>



<p>Trainees aren’t kept in a bubble. They visit corporate houses, retail outlets, and private companies during their training period.<br>They learn conflict management, customer handling, workplace ethics, all the unscripted, real-world skills that make the difference between just having a job and thriving in it.</p>



<p>This industry exposure isn&#8217;t an afterthought. It is a philosophy: prepare them for the world as it is, not as we wish it were.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Scaling the future: From thousands to millions</strong></h2>



<p>Smile Foundation’s success is not a lucky accident. It is proof that skilling works when done holistically, pragmatically, and passionately.</p>



<p>But the scale of the challenge ahead demands even more:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Massive expansion</strong> of skilling infrastructure into rural India</li>



<li><strong>Greater private sector involvement</strong> through <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" title="Corporate Partnerships" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="406" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">CSR</a> funding and employment partnerships</li>



<li><strong>New skilling models</strong> for emerging sectors — green energy, AI, biotechnology</li>



<li><strong>Policy support</strong> that incentivizes hiring of first-generation skilled youth</li>
</ul>



<p>Without this, the demographic dividend risks becoming a demographic liability — millions of angry, alienated youth with nowhere to go.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Skilling India is the new freedom</strong></h3>



<p>Seventy-seven years ago, India fought for its independance. Today, its youth fight for economic indepedance — the freedom to dream, to choose, to build.</p>



<p>If we fail to skill our youth now, no amount of GDP growth or stock market highs will save us from the social, political, and economic collapse that will follow.</p>



<p>India&#8217;s demographic dividend is a race against time.<br><strong>It is a race we simply cannot afford to lose.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a world defined by the next click, swipe, or update, life is no longer just lived—it is rushed. “Fast food,” “fast fashion,” “fast communication,” “quick transport,” “instant pay”—our collective reality is now dictated by speed. German sociologist Hartmut Rosa coined this growing phenomenon as <em>social acceleration</em>—a sweeping shift in the rhythm of life brought on by the technological revolutions of the modern era.</p>



<p>This acceleration is not just a cultural undercurrent—it is a structural force with real implications for livelihoods, particularly in emerging economies like India. With digital transformation altering how we live, work, and connect, millions are negotiating this rapid shift in real time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is social acceleration?</strong></h2>



<p>Social acceleration refers to the intensifying pace of social change, driven largely by technological and digital evolution. As cultural theorist Paul Virilio suggested, it&#8217;s about speeding through space and experience where sending a letter becomes an instant message, road journeys become flights, and saving money becomes tap-and-pay.</p>



<p>In practical terms, social acceleration means we’re working more efficiently but also feeling increasingly overwhelmed. Time is compressed, and the boundaries between work, rest, and play are increasingly blurred. At the heart of this shift is digitisation which is both a driver and a product of acceleration.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Digitisation and livelihoods: A complex relationship</strong></h3>



<p>India, one of the fastest-digitising economies in the world, embodies this phenomenon. According to the <em>Bharat 2.0 Internet Study (2021)</em>, rural India surpassed urban areas in internet user growth—an astonishing 20% higher. Even more encouraging, female internet users were growing at nearly triple the rate of their male counterparts. The National Family <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1442" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Health</a> Survey (NFHS-5) further confirms that technology is transforming lives.</p>



<p>Access to digital tools has opened doors to <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" title="Livelihood" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="609" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">livelihood</a> opportunities that didn’t exist before. Faster communication and improved information access have transformed rural agriculture, expanded health services, and improved access to sanitation and clean energy fueling progress at the grassroots.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Employment opportunities</strong></h4>



<p>Social acceleration has enabled remote work, gig economy platforms, and e-commerce, empowering people to earn from almost anywhere. From artisans in Rajasthan selling products on digital platforms to rural coders contributing to global tech firms, geography is no longer a constraint.</p>



<p>The gig economy, though fraught with regulatory gaps, has allowed many young Indians to freelance, earn income, and build skills through platforms like Urban Company, Freelancer, and Swiggy.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Entrepreneurship in motion</strong></h4>



<p>Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) have flourished as digital tools democratise access to information, marketing, and capital. Women and youth, particularly in low-income communities, now create home-run businesses through mobile phones, WhatsApp groups, and YouTube channels.</p>



<p>Supported by microfinance institutions and digital payment systems, these entrepreneurs use social media to build customer bases, establish branding, and bypass traditional market gatekeepers.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Financial and social inclusion</strong></h4>



<p>The internet has become a key enabler of financial inclusion. Women, who were previously excluded from banking systems, now access credit, insurance, and government subsidies through mobile platforms. Technology is enabling more women to vote, attend health appointments, and access child support services.</p>



<p>This has triggered what one might call a “silent revolution”—where social acceleration doesn’t just improve lives, it transforms gender norms. When women gain digital access, they also gain agency.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The shadow side of speed</strong></h3>



<p>Despite its promise, social acceleration also brings serious risks, especially for vulnerable populations.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Digital Divide and Literacy Gaps</strong>: Not everyone benefits equally. Poor connectivity, device affordability, and low digital literacy still marginalize millions, particularly the elderly, disabled, and rural populations in remote areas.</li>



<li><strong>Mental Burnout</strong>: The pressure to always be available, always be improving, and always be earning—driven by algorithmic platforms—has created a culture of overwork. Young people are reporting higher rates of anxiety, and gig workers often operate without safety nets or formal labour protections.</li>



<li><strong>Alienation and Erosion of Community</strong>: In an age of hyperconnectivity, meaningful connection has often taken a backseat. As Rosa warns, acceleration can lead to a sense of alienation—where people experience the world as fragmented, unpredictable, and beyond control.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smile Foundation: Bridging the acceleration gap</strong></h3>



<p>Smile Foundation’s <a href="https://donate.smilefoundationindia.org/donate-for-livelihood/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">livelihood programme</a> is one such effort to humanize the digital transformation. By working directly with underemployed youth from low-income communities, the programme provides market-driven skill training and placement support.</p>



<p>Through curated curricula, industry-aligned training, and a network of trainers, the programme connects youth with sectors showing high employment potential—retail, logistics, healthcare, and IT. <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Smile Foundation</a>’s work aligns with India’s <em>Skill India</em> Mission and the global SDGs, particularly Goals 4 (Quality Education) and 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth).</p>



<p>The aim is simple but powerful: equip the next generation with the tools to participate meaningfully in an accelerated world and not just survive it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Where do we go from here?</strong></h3>



<p>If social acceleration is here to stay, we must evolve systems to keep pace—ethically, inclusively, and sustainably. This requires:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Digital Infrastructure Expansion</strong>: Universal broadband access and mobile literacy must be prioritised to bridge the urban-rural digital divide.</li>



<li><strong>Policy Innovation</strong>: Protections for gig workers, fair wages, and platform accountability should accompany digital growth.</li>



<li><strong>Mental Health Support</strong>: As speed increases, we must build systems that allow pause, reflection, and balance. This includes integrating mental wellness into <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2447" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> and employment programs.</li>



<li><strong>Human-Centered Design</strong>: Livelihood programs should focus on the user—not just the technology. Interventions must be tailored, empathetic, and culturally grounded.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>In conclusion</strong>, social acceleration is both a challenge and an opportunity. Its pace can uplift lives or leave people behind. But with thoughtful intervention, inclusive technology, and organisations like Smile Foundation leading grassroots change, acceleration doesn’t have to be alienating—it can be liberating.</p>



<p>If harnessed correctly, we can ensure that speed serves society, not the other way around.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each year, on 14th April, India solemnly celebrates Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Jayanti, marking the birth anniversary of the principal architect of the Indian Constitution and a tireless champion for social justice. As we observe Ambedkar Jayanti 2025, it becomes essential to reflect not only on his monumental contributions but also on the relevance of his ideals—liberty, equality, and fraternity—in our modern-day context. His enduring vision continues to guide movements for social reform and inspire institutions, including numerous NGOs in India, which strive to build an inclusive and just society.</p>
<h3><b>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar: A Visionary for the Marginalised</b></h3>
<p>Born in 1891 into a marginalised Dalit family,<a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1916229" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> Dr Ambedkar’s life</a> was a testament to resilience and intellectual brilliance. Rising above entrenched discrimination, he emerged as a formidable scholar, economist, and social reformer. His most historic achievement—drafting the Indian Constitution—laid the groundwork for a democratic republic rooted in equality, justice, and human dignity.</p>
<p>Central to Dr. Ambedkar’s philosophy was the belief that <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2442" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> and economic empowerment were essential to dismantling social hierarchies. He championed Dalit rights, fought for women’s emancipation, and emphasised the necessity of labour reforms, shaping policies that still resonate in India’s socio-political framework.</p>
<h3><b>Why Ambedkar’s ideals still matter in 2025</b></h3>
<p>Even in today’s India, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar’s teachings hold profound significance. Social inequities, caste-based discrimination, and economic disparity persist, making his principles a roadmap to address the challenges of our time:</p>
<h4><strong><i>1. Social Justice and Equal Opportunity</i></strong></h4>
<p>Unequal resources and opportunities remains a challenging reality, particularly in rural and underserved communities. Dr. Ambedkar’s advocacy for affirmative action and reservation policies has enabled countless individuals to access education and employment. Yet, ongoing efforts are vital to extend these opportunities universally.</p>
<h4><strong><i>2. Education as a Catalyst for Change</i></strong></h4>
<p>Dr. Ambedkar famously declared education as the<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/4899410.pdf?abstractid=4899410&amp;mirid=1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> “milk of a lioness,”</a> urging the oppressed to pursue learning with courage. In the digital era, educational inequity remains a challenge, especially in rural India. His call for inclusive and quality education remains ever-relevant.</p>
<h4><strong><i>3. Economic Empowerment and Livelihood</i></strong></h4>
<p>His commitment to economic justice—through land reforms, wage security, and employment opportunities—serves as a cornerstone for current policies targeting poverty alleviation and inclusive growth. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/smile-foundation_tayyarikalki-activity-7312814918062194689-8W6g?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAC5evssB-CzXX8WTwACOEZZ4RFtymRGUt_s" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Livelihood programmes</a> that provide vocational training and promote self-employment are clear extensions of his vision.</p>
<h4><strong><i>4. Women’s Rights and Gender Equality</i></strong></h4>
<p>Dr. Ambedkar was one of the earliest advocates for<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/smile-foundation_swabhiman-womenempowerment-financialindependence-activity-7309920002260799488-mG_O?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAC5evssB-CzXX8WTwACOEZZ4RFtymRGUt_s" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> women’s rights</a>, championing reforms that granted them agency in marriage, property, and employment. Today, his legacy lives on through initiatives that seek to ensure equal pay, reproductive rights, and political representation for women.</p>
<h4><strong><i>5. Democracy and Constitutional Morality</i></strong></h4>
<p>In an age of global political flux, Dr. Ambedkar’s belief in constitutional morality and democratic governance is more relevant than ever. His insistence on upholding civil liberties and secular values offers crucial guidance in preserving the spirit of Indian democracy.</p>
<h3><b>How NGOs in India continue to uphold Ambedkar’s vision</b></h3>
<p>Across the country, NGOs in India remain committed to carrying forward Dr. Ambedkar’s legacy. Smile Foundation too works towards bringing change for good at the grassroot communities of India, aligning its efforts with his principles through a holistic and integrated approach to development.</p>
<p>Founded in 2005,<a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow"> Smile Foundation</a> quickly recognised that education alone could not guarantee the holistic development of underprivileged children. We understood that systemic barriers—starting with poor maternal and neonatal care—impacted a child’s ability to thrive from the earliest stages of life.</p>
<p>From lack of healthcare to limited access to trained educators and infrastructure, children in rural and marginalised communities face multifaceted obstacles. Financial hardship often compels families to withdraw children—especially girls—from school, while undernutrition and poor sanitation perpetuate cycles of poverty and vulnerability.</p>
<p>In response, <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/need-based-approach-of-smile-foundation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Smile Foundation adopted a life-cycle approach</a> to address the interlinked issues affecting individuals and communities by offering integrated solutions in education, healthcare, and livelihood.</p>
<h3><b>The life-cycle approach: Nurturing change from cradle to career and beyond</b></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Mission Education aligns with the <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/learning-how-to-learn-national-education-policy-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">National Education Policy</a>, focusing on foundational literacy, numeracy, and STEM disciplines, ensuring children develop strong cognitive and critical thinking skills.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Smile on Wheels mobile <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1438" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> units bring essential medical services, including diagnostics, outpatient care, and free medication, to under-resourced communities.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Swabhiman champions maternal, menstrual, and neonatal health, creating awareness about hygiene and equipping women with knowledge crucial for their wellbeing.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">STeP and advanced vocational training programmes empower youth and women with the skills required for employment and entrepreneurship, thus enhancing economic self-sufficiency.</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Ambedkar’s ideals and the life-cycle approach: A shared vision</b></h3>
<p>Dr. Ambedkar envisioned an India where every citizen, regardless of birth, had the chance to realise their full potential. His insistence on structural reform, access to education, economic equity, and gender equality finds deep resonance in Smile Foundation’s life-cycle approach.</p>
<p>Both stand for a future where transformation is not episodic, but continuous—built layer by layer, across generations and therefore, as we mark the 134th Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Jayanti in 2025, let us do more than remember his legacy—let us live it. </p>
<p>Let’s build a society where equality is not an aspiration but a reality. <a href="https://donate.smilefoundationindia.org/donate-for-education/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Support children with education </a>and their communities an empowered life. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a small village of Maharashtra, two families found themselves embroiled in a bitter conflict over shared water source in the area. This was because both of the families sustained themselves through water-intensive farming which meant that there was never enough resources available for both of them to cultivate their crops without a hassle. This conflict kept growing until it reached the point of turning violent. However, an intervention by the local NGO changed the whole situation. Through its support, both the families learnt about sustainable agricultural practices, diversification of crops, and minimizing the use and wastage of water. At the same time, they also learnt about alternative <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" title="Livelihood" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="607" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">livelihood</a> opportunities like dairy farming which meant they were not solely dependent on agriculture for sustenance.</p>



<p>This proved to be a life changing intervention for both the families as it significantly reduced their dependency on the shared water resource and, in turn, solved the conflict that had been brewing for years. Not just that, it also provided a sense of security and respectability to them as they could now earn extra money and invest more in their children’s <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2432" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a>. This story illustrates a profound truth &#8211; respectable livelihoods can transform lives and reduce conflicts over scarce resources.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Link between livelihoods and resource conflicts</strong></h2>



<p>Today, the global population has grown to a level where it is putting a lot of stress on the natural resources available to us. In India, this problem is even bigger, as the country has now surpassed China to become the most populous in the world. This also means that many people have to migrate from rural areas to the urban centres in search of work as resource shortages make it more and more difficult for them to survive off the land. This is why, providing sustainable and dignified livelihood opportunities to these people can reduce the conflict that gets created as these rural-urban migrants continue to fight for even more limited resources in the cities.</p>



<p>Resource conflicts often arise when communities compete for access to limited natural resources such as water, arable land, and forests. These conflicts are exacerbated by factors such as population growth, climate change, and economic inequality. Livelihoods are also deeply intertwined with one’s sense of self-respect and dignity. If an individual does not have access to basic resources like water, sanitation, hygienic public spaces, etc., they are likely to get into conflict with others to claim the most they can, often at the expense of others.</p>



<p>This is why it is extremely important that timely interventions are made to provide alternative income sources to people to reduce their reliance on some limited public goods. Globally, we have seen many such examples of interventions that led to incredible turnarounds. Let us look at some examples:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Rwanda’s coffee cooperatives – </strong>After the Rwandan genocide, coffee cooperatives played a crucial role in rebuilding communities and reducing resource conflicts. By providing farmers with a stable income and access to international markets, these cooperatives fostered economic stability and reconciliation.</li>



<li><strong>Kenya’s water resource management – </strong>In Kenya, water was a major reason for conflict in arid regions, but a community-based water management programme brought down these conflicts significantly. Local communities were taught new livelihood techniques like beekeeping, poultry farming, etc., which reduced their dependence on the shared water resources.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Livelihoods and resource conflicts in India</strong></h2>



<p>India, with its diverse geography and growing population, faces significant challenges related to resource conflicts. Disputes over water, land, and forests are common, particularly in rural and tribal areas. However, several initiatives have demonstrated the potential of livelihoods to address these conflicts:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Watershed development programmes &#8211; </strong>In states like Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, watershed development programmes have improved water availability and agricultural productivity. By involving local communities in planning and implementation, these programmes have reduced conflicts over water resources and enhanced livelihoods.</li>



<li><strong>Forest Rights Act (FRA) &#8211; </strong>The FRA recognizes the rights of tribal communities to access and manage forest resources. By providing legal recognition and promoting sustainable livelihoods such as agroforestry and non-timber forest product collection, the FRA has reduced tensions between tribal communities and forest authorities.</li>



<li><strong>MGNREGA &#8211; </strong>The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) provides rural households with guaranteed employment and income. By reducing economic vulnerability, MGNREGA has alleviated resource-related conflicts and improved social cohesion.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Strategies to promote respectable livelihoods</strong></h2>



<p>While a lot has been done in this area, we must remember that the problem of resource shortages is only going to increase in the future. Therefore, we must first of all focus on more sustainable ways of living which reduces our burden on these resources. At the same time, we should encourage the affluent section of our society to adopt these sustainable practices aggressively. With all this, we should also look at promoting respectable livelihoods for everyone. Here are some of the strategies to achieve that:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong><a href="https://donate.smilefoundationindia.org/donate-for-livelihood/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Skill development</a> – </strong>The first and most important intervention is to provide skilling opportunities to the people who are engaged in livelihoods that are facing the biggest threat due to resource shortage. By providing them vocational training, we can help them to move to more lucrative employment and also increase their income levels. At the same time, it may be a good opportunity for them to live a more respectable life.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://donate.smilefoundationindia.org/women-empowerment/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Access to finance</a> – </strong>Many individuals living in rural areas, smaller cities, or remote regions of the country can become micro entrepreneurs if they have access to collateral free finance. By providing them money to kickstart their small or micro business, we can ensure that they are not just finding respectable livelihoods for themselves but are also creating jobs for others.</li>



<li><strong>Community-based approach – </strong>Involving local communities in resource management and decision-making can foster cooperation and reduce conflicts. Programmes like Joint Forest Management (JFM) and Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) empower communities to manage resources sustainably.</li>
</ol>



<p>Resource shortages can be directly linked to human conflict and also impact the individual’s dignity. Not just that, it can have a severe impact on the livelihoods of people who depend directly on these resources. Therefore, it is essential that we create opportunities for people to move towards alternate, respectable livelihoods in order to reduce conflict. By providing individuals and communities with stable income sources, we can address the root causes of resource dependency and promote social harmony.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“The soul of India lives in its villages&#8221;</em> &#8211; Mahatma Gandhi</p>
</blockquote>



<p>India&#8217;s rural population forms most of its society and is integral to all its development policies. Working towards developing rural areas and villages is essential for driving inclusive and sustainable growth and helping restrict rural-urban migration, primarily due to rural poverty coupled with basic infrastructural needs. Rural communities are typically impoverished, with limited access to infrastructure development. Although several small firms are growing in and around these areas, only a few big organisations and industries can generate employment. As a result, modernised processes and technological advances have limited influence and adoption due to the lack of necessary infrastructure to support technological efficiency. </p>



<p>Further, the COVID-19 epidemic, along with persistently high levels of poverty and inequality, threatened the progress of the world&#8217;s rural people. However, the epidemic has also demonstrated that modern technologies can allow rural communities to thrive, bridging the rural-urban gap.</p>



<p>Technological advancement is a key development factor in rural India. They can result in higher and improved production, socioeconomic equality, the integration of contemporary technologies, and long-term growth, all considered cornerstones of a country&#8217;s success.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Impact of technology and innovation on rural livelihood</strong></h2>



<p>With a vision to strengthen rural India, several efforts to incorporate digital learning, technology-based labour work, healthcare apps, and so on have boosted the labour market and impacted agricultural activities. Enhanced innovation has improved rural areas&#8217; growth prospects, with policymakers diving deeper into bringing about technology to sector-specific measures.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Technology in facilitating agricultural growth</strong></h3>



<p>Technology has a critical role in expediting rural development by addressing inefficiencies. Precision in agriculture tools, such as remote sensing, drones, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, help farmers maximise resource utilisation, reduce waste, and boost yields. Further, real-time weather information, soil <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1424" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> monitoring, and crop disease detection via mobile applications enable farmers to make informed decisions and take preventive steps, ultimately improving agricultural outcomes. As a result, farmers&#8217; incomes can increase dramatically.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Maintaining transparency with information&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Openness and effective information exchange are critical for formalising the rural economy and creating a favourable investment climate. Technology fosters the transparent sharing of information and allows for efficient resource monitoring. Digital platforms can be designed to help farmers get market information, connect them with buyers and suppliers, and ensure fair prices. Furthermore, blockchain technology can promote transparency in supply networks, trace the origin of agricultural produce, and combat fraud. By leveraging technology to create transparent and efficient procedures, stakeholders can gain trust, attract more investment, and support equitable growth.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Healthcare, education, and financial inclusion&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Technology can also help with other aspects of rural development, such as healthcare, education, and financial inclusion. Telemedicine systems connect remote people with healthcare professionals, ensuring rapid access to medical advice and treatments. This helps to alleviate healthcare-related issues and enhances overall well-being. Furthermore, e-learning systems can deliver high-quality education to remote locations, providing rural kids with information and skills for the future. Technology-enabled financial services, such as digital banking and mobile payments, give rural areas more accessible and secure access to financial products and services.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Digital literacy among farmers&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Digital literacy is rising in rural India, providing more people with technological skills and offering new business opportunities. Growing awareness of digital technology and solutions among the younger generation of farmers and Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) has resulted in the rise of novel business models throughout the agriculture value chain. These models have several steps, including inputs, harvesting, processing, and distribution. As a result, this transformation reduces rural migration and draws national and international investors, promoting agro-industry development.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Technology-enabled rural development schemes </strong></h2>



<p>In recent years, the Indian government has implemented schemes and policies ranging from education to financial literacy, agritech, and skill development that effectively provide basic social infrastructure to rural people.<br><br><strong>Technological Advancement for Rural Areas (TARA):</strong> This scheme under the Skill Enhancement Education &amp; Development Program (SEED) is critical in providing long-term support to science-based voluntary organisations and field institutions in rural and other disadvantaged areas and helping with technological solutions and effective delivery of technologies for <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" title="Livelihood" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="604" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">livelihood</a> generation.</p>



<p><strong>Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission:</strong> The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) seeks to build the infrastructure required to enable India&#8217;s integrated digital healthcare network. It will employ digital highways to connect different actors in the healthcare industry.</p>



<p><strong>Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA): </strong>ABHA is the driving force behind safer and more efficient digital health records. A digitally secure ABHA enables health data access and sharing with participating healthcare providers and payers. Anyone wanting to join ABDM with digital health records must establish ABHA first. People are recognised and authenticated, and their health records are linked across several systems and stakeholders (with informed consent).</p>



<p><strong>Digital India Programme: </strong>Digital India is India&#8217;s flagship initiative to transform the country into a knowledge-based economy and a digitally empowered society. Digital India focuses on three key areas: digital infrastructure as a utility for all citizens, governance and on-demand services, and citizen empowerment through digital technology.</p>



<p><strong>Digital India Land Records Modernisation Programme (DILRMP</strong>): A central sector scheme to build a digital repository for modernising land records in rural India, essentially creating a transparent and accessible system for managing land ownership information across the country. The initiative has sanctioned over 1,000 Watershed Development Components of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana projects to 28 States and 2 UTs of J&amp;K and Ladakh.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smile Foundation’s work</strong></h3>



<p>To bring technology into education and help impact rural livelihoods and students in underprivileged areas, Smile Foundation is improving its learning centres by adding smart classrooms, solar panels, and digital tools like learning software and educational tablets. We also run scholarship programs with partners like Deutsche Bank, Quantiphi, Quest Global, and Siemens. Through these programs, thousands of students receive laptops and other essential resources for online learning.</p>



<p>As part of our <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Mission Education</a> program, we set up Tab Labs in rural schools. These tablets come with videos, reading materials, quizzes, and lessons designed for each grade level, making learning fun and accessible for young children.</p>



<p>We aim to ensure that no child is left behind and that every student is prepared for a brighter future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Sunita, a domestic violence survivor from a small village in Rajasthan, decided to take charge of her life and reached out to a local women’s self-help group to seek their support. With the help of the group, she got access to microfinance and guidance to start her own tailoring business from home. She started her journey as the first woman entrepreneur from her village and, in turn, motivated many other women from her community to pursue independence.</p>



<p>Over time, Sunita became financially independent and also expanded her business as the demand grew. In the process, she employed two more women from her village who were also survivors of domestic abuse. The newfound financial independence and collective strength of women created a shift in societal attitudes, fostering respect and reducing instances of gender-based violence. The women acted as each other&#8217;s support and defended anyone who faced instances of violence or abuse.</p>



<p>This example shows the power that women can hold when they are financially independent and running their own businesses. Not just that, they also empower other women in the process, become more aware and confident about their rights, and are able to band together and fight against the injustices.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gender-based Violence: A Global and Indian Perspective</strong></h2>



<p>To an urban Indian, it may feel like gender-based violence is now a thing of the past. We do not see advertisements like ‘<em>ghanti bajao campaign’ </em>on television anymore asking people to intervene when they come across instances of domestic abuse in their neighbourhood. However, the problem is far from over. According to the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/violence-against-women" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">World Health Organization (WHO)</a>, approximately 1 in 3 women globally have experienced physical or sexual violence in their lifetime, most often by an intimate partner.</p>



<p>In India, we saw a rather grim picture especially during the COVID-19 induced lockdown when an increase in the cases of domestic violence was reported. According to the <a href="https://www.isdm.org.in/blog/its-womens-day-but-on-ground-little-has-changed" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB)</a> data, there was a 12.9% increase in crimes against women between 2018 and 2022, with domestic violence, sexual assault, and harassment being the most common forms. Gender-based violence is not just about physical assault but it also acts as a way of restricting the women from achieving autonomy.</p>



<p>It has far-reaching consequences on women&#8217;s physical and mental <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1423" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a>, economic productivity, and social well-being. While there are strong legal frameworks in place to deal with this problem, many cases still go unreported or are solved at a local level to avoid any shame and embarrassment for the parties involved. The women who are victims of gender-based violence are also subjected to scrutiny from the society on various levels, making it even more difficult for them to speak up and take a stand.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How More Women in Business Can Translate to Less Gender-based Violence</strong></h2>



<p>This is where entrepreneurship among women can play a pivotal role. Here’s how it can help in reducing gender-based violence:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Financial independence – </strong>As we saw above in the case of Sunita, financial independence gave her the opportunity to create a healthy life for herself and also help other women in the process. Being independent financially is the key to taking a stand for yourself when you are in trouble. When women are dependent on others financially, they also lack the power to stand up against mental or physical violence.</li>



<li><strong>Challenging patriarchy – </strong>Women in business challenge traditional gender roles and stereotypes, fostering a culture of equality and respect. As women gain visibility and influence in the economic sphere, societal attitudes towards gender roles begin to shift.</li>



<li><strong>Community progress – </strong>When women enter into businesses, they not only create a path for self-progress but also support other women in their community. At the same time, it has been observed that educated and independent women are also able to ensure better health and <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2427" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> for their children as well.</li>



<li><strong>Creating role models – </strong>Successful women become strong role models in society and those women who are suffering from gender-based violence can turn to them in times of distress.</li>



<li><strong>Workplace equality – </strong>Women in leadership positions are more likely to implement policies that address gender-based violence, such as anti-harassment measures and support systems for survivors. This creates safer and more inclusive workplaces.</li>
</ol>



<p>Apart from these, there are many other ways in which women in businesses can have a direct impact on reducing gender-based violence. For example, it was found in a <a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/how_businesses_can_take_the_lead_in_combatting_gender_based_violence" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">study in Uganda</a> that women who participated in economic empowerment programs experienced a 50% reduction in intimate partner violence. Similarly, <a href="https://www.ifc.org/content/dam/ifc/doclink/2023/bfp-toolkit-for-action-gbv.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">companies with women in leadership roles</a> have shown to adopt more inclusive and equitable workplace practices, contributing to a decline in workplace harassment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bringing More Women into Businesses</strong></h2>



<p>Now that we understand the positive impact of women in businesses, the question is how we can ensure that more and more women have the opportunity to take this path. Here are some of the solutions:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Access to finance – </strong>The most basic and also the most important aspect of starting a business is to have enough money for making an initial investment and setting up the business. While finance is easily accessible to people who already possess wealth, it may also be easier for men to get access to it because of the availability of collateral. Therefore, it is crucial that women are provided access to collateral-free loans, especially at subsidized interest rates, to enable them to take the risk and start a business.</li>



<li><strong>Skill development –</strong> Secondly, it is essential that women who have never had the chance to develop necessary skills to run a business are provided the support to learn this through capacity building workshops and peer support. Both government and non-government organizations have been working in this area in India. </li>



<li><strong>Mentorship – </strong>Mentorship programs and networking opportunities can provide women with guidance, resources, and connections to succeed in business. Platforms like <a href="https://msme.gov.in/women-entrepreneurs" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Udyam Sakhi and TiE Women</a> are fostering such ecosystems. </li>



<li><strong>Policy support – </strong>Another important step is to create policy interventions that support women entrepreneurs, especially those coming from lesser privileged backgrounds and regions. This way, more and more women will find the motivation to start their own businesses.</li>
</ol>



<p>There are many other ways through which women can be encouraged to start businesses. These include awareness campaigns by the media, social change, and even creating a safe work environment for them. In the end, all these initiatives can come together to create an opportunity for women to become successful business owners.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smile’s Work</strong></h2>



<p>Smile Foundation&#8217;s <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/women-empowerment/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Swabhiman</a> initiative focuses on empowering underserved women through education, health, and livelihood programs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Smile Foundation&#8217;s Swabhiman initiative is a comprehensive women&#8217;s empowerment program aimed at bringing pride and dignity to marginalized and socially excluded women and girls. Launched in 2005, Swabhiman, meaning &#8216;self-respect&#8217; in English, seeks to enable women to realize their self-esteem and optimum potential in every sphere of life through innovative community engagement strategies.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Key Components of the Swabhiman Initiative:</strong></p>



<p><strong>4 S Model:</strong> The program operates through a highly effective approach known as the &#8216;4 S Model,&#8217; which stands for:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Seeking Healthcare as a Behavior:</strong> Encouraging women to prioritize and seek necessary healthcare services.</li>



<li><strong>Support through Education:</strong> Providing educational opportunities to empower women with knowledge and skills.</li>



<li><strong>Support from Men through Male Involvement:</strong> Engaging men in the community to support women&#8217;s empowerment and challenge traditional gender roles.</li>



<li><strong>Sustaining Change in the Community:</strong> Ensuring long-term positive changes through community involvement and ownership.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Healthcare and Nutrition:</strong> The initiative focuses on maternal and child healthcare, menstrual health awareness, and nutrition enhancement. For instance, in Sangrur, community-based events called &#8216;godh-bharai&#8217; celebrate forthcoming motherhood, providing pregnant women with necessary information on birth preparedness, breastfeeding, and nutrition. citeturn0search6<br></p>



<p><strong>Skill Development and Entrepreneurship:</strong> Swabhiman provides business skills training to capacitate women to start their own enterprises. This empowers them to become financially independent, improve their quality of life, and advocate for women&#8217;s rights, thereby creating sustainable and empowered communities.<br></p>



<p><strong>Partnerships for Impact:</strong> Collaborations with organizations like Children&#8217;s International Foundation (CIF) address critical health, nutrition, education, and skill development needs for children and caregivers. This comprehensive approach impacts thousands, providing a holistic improvement in well-being and future opportunities.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Impact of the Swabhiman Initiative</strong></h3>



<p>Since its inception, Swabhiman has empowered over 150,000 women through various interventions. More than 1,000 women and adolescent girls trained as change agents are leading community initiatives and advocating for women&#8217;s rights. The initiative&#8217;s lifecycle approach ensures that education, healthcare, and <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" title="Livelihood" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="603" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">livelihood</a> opportunities reach the most vulnerable at every stage of their lives, fostering respect and reducing instances of gender-based violence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The intersection of economic empowerment and gender equality offers a powerful pathway to address gender-based violence. By bringing more women into business, we can challenge the structural inequalities that perpetuate violence and create a society where women are respected and valued. While progress has been made, much work remains to be done to ensure that women have equal opportunities to thrive in the economic sphere.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>India has embarked on an incredible journey of growth and development ever since its independence in 1947. The country transformed from predominantly being an agrarian economy to building manufacturing capabilities and a robust services industry. In this growth story, one thing that has played a crucial role is infrastructural development. From building roads and dams to establishing schools, hospitals, and railways, infrastructure has been the backbone of India&#8217;s progress, driving economic growth, and improving quality of life.</p>



<p>Owing to the vision of our founding fathers, India invested heavily in infrastructural development in the decades following independence. This included the expansion of national highways and railway networks, the building of <strong>major dams like Bhakra Nangal</strong>, and the establishment of premium institutions like the IITs and AIIMS. In recent decades, we have also seen a focus on urban infrastructure development with projects like Metro Rail, tunnels, and much more. Thus, as India enters a new era, it needs to continue focusing on building stronger infrastructural capabilities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Infrastructural Needs for India</strong></h2>



<p>There are many areas in which India can focus. But, here are a few key areas that require consistent attention for the holistic development of Indian urban as well as rural communities:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Road Network: </strong>For any economy to grow, mobility of movement is most important. This is why expanding a robust road network in the form of national and state highways, expressways, etc., needs to be a priority. India&#8217;s ambitious <em><a href="https://www.india.gov.in/spotlight/bharatmala-pariyojana-stepping-stone-towards-new-india" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">Bharatmala Pariyojana</a></em> aims to develop 83,677 kilometres of highways, improving connectivity in remote and underserved regions.</li>



<li><strong>Dams</strong>: As the requirements of the country’s growing population increase, there will be a bigger need for water management, electricity generation, irrigation facilities, and much more. This is where building new dams can be a game-changer. Apart from that, India is also focusing on river-linking projects aimed at diverting water from areas that experience flooding to those areas that are affected by drought.</li>



<li><strong>Educational Institutions: </strong>The Indian government has been working sincerely towards expanding the number of AIIMS and IITs in the country. In addition, <strong>new universities, schools, and colleges need to be built.</strong> Existing institutions also need an infrastructural boost in the form of smart upgrades to make them relevant.</li>



<li><strong>Hospitals: </strong>A large part of the Indian population is deprived, even today, of good quality healthcare facilities, as most of the big hospitals are concentrated in urban areas<strong> forcing rural and tribal populations to flock to cities like Chandigarh, Delhi, Hyderabad, etc.,</strong> for receiving adequate health support. However, this is not sustainable, and the country needs to work on expanding its healthcare network. This can also be done through the development of digital infrastructure like telemedicine facilities, mobile hospitals, etc.</li>



<li><strong>Railways:</strong> This is arguably the lifeline of India; even today because of the reach and affordability, lakhs of Indians travel through railways. This is the reason why the government must keep pushing for the expansion of railways in regions where it hasn’t yet reached. The recent expansion of the railway network to <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/on-republic-day-eve-vande-bharat-express-touches-base-in-kashmir-for-first-time/article69140341.ece" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">Srinagar in Kashmir </a>and the building of the world&#8217;s highest railway bridge is a good example of it. Apart from this, another way of improving the mobility of Indians is by building more airports across the country and making air travel affordable for the masses.</li>



<li><strong>Other infrastructure: </strong>In addition to roads, dams, schools, hospitals, and railways, other critical infrastructure includes airports, ports, and digital connectivity. Developing world-class airports and ports can boost trade and tourism, while expanding digital infrastructure ensures access to information and services, bridging the digital divide.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Needs and Aspirations</strong></h2>



<p>As India continues to grow and evolve, it is essential to focus on the future needs and aspirations of the population. Here are some key areas where India should continue investing in infrastructure:</p>



<p><strong>Sustainable Development:</strong> While developing infrastructure is essential, what is also needed is a focus on sustainability. As India moves forward, it also needs to play an important role in establishing itself as a climate-conscious nation. Therefore, the country should focus on investing in <strong>environment-friendly practices and investing in renewable energy.</strong> India is already on the path of building these capabilities. It needs to continue building on these efforts.</p>



<p><strong>Healthcare expansion: </strong>As discussed above, India still faces a major challenge when it comes to providing equitable access to good quality healthcare facilities to its population. The COVID-19 pandemic also revealed many loopholes in India’s healthcare infrastructure. There, it is essential that all the stakeholders work together in building facilities for all Indians. Digital solutions are going to play a crucial role in this. Policies like universal health insurance are also going to ease the burden on the poorer masses.</p>



<p><strong>Digital connectivity</strong>: Expanding digital infrastructure is critical for bridging the digital divide and ensuring access to information and services. Initiatives like Digital India aim to provide high-speed internet connectivity to rural and remote areas, enabling digital literacy, e-governance, and digital financial inclusion.</p>



<p><strong>Educational Infrastructure: </strong>Investing in educational infrastructure at all levels, from primary schools to higher education institutions, is essential for fostering innovation and human capital development. Enhancing vocational training centers and skill development programs can equip the workforce in India with the necessary skills for a rapidly changing job market.</p>



<p><strong>Transportation and logistics: </strong>Developing efficient transportation and logistics infrastructure can boost trade and economic growth. Expanding the railway network, modernizing ports and airports, and improving last-mile connectivity are critical for enhancing India&#8217;s competitiveness in the global market.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>For major economies like the United States, Europe, China, etc., infrastructural development has played a central role in their development and growth. These countries continue to invest heavily in further enhancing their capabilities. For example, China’s Belt and Road Initiative is aimed at establishing its dominance in trade around the world. Similarly, Japan’s focus on technology has made it a leader in this area.</p>



<p>As India continues its journey towards becoming a global economic powerhouse, investing in infrastructure remains a critical priority. By focusing on sustainable development, healthcare, digital connectivity, education, and transportation, India can build a stronger and more resilient nation that meets the needs and aspirations of its people. Infrastructural development is not just about building physical structures; it is about creating opportunities, improving quality of life, and fostering social and economic progress.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smile’s Contribution</strong></h3>



<p>Smile Foundation helps develop infrastructure primarily by improving <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education </a>and <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">healthcare</a> facilities in underserved areas.
