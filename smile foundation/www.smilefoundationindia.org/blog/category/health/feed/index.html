<p>Every morning before dawn, Dhanam, a small business owner in Chennai, prepares her idli stall for the day. Fatigue was her constant companion till a free checkup by the Smile on Wheels mobile medical unit revealed that she had diabetes. With access to timely guidance and care delivered close to home, she has been able to manage both her health and her livelihood without missing a single customer in a day.</p>



<p>While India’s urban medical infrastructure has emerged as a global benchmark attracting international patients with its world-class hospitals and advanced treatments, the same cannot be said for rural healthcare. But this sheen of excellence fades quickly as one moves beyond city limits. In rural and underserved areas, healthcare is often an afterthought which remains delayed, distant, and fragmented.</p>



<p>The issue is not only the absence of hospitals or beds, but the critical shortage of skilled and often overlooked, shortage of skilled healthcare workers. Hospitals and clinics can be built, but without trained professionals to staff them, they remain symbols of intent rather than engines of impact.</p>



<p>A healthcare system without trained caregivers is a system destined to fail. For business leaders, CSR professionals, and policymakers, this challenge also presents an opportunity. Investing in rural health is a strategic investment in the nation’s social and economic infrastructure. Strengthening the rural health workforce fuels productivity, resilience, and long-term development goals. It ensures that no life remains unreachable, and that India’s rural healthcare transformation is truly inclusive.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rural-healthcare-workforce-deficit"><strong>Rural Healthcare Workforce Deficit</strong></h2>



<p>In India where healthcare professionals are often revered as “gods,” the expansion of modern hospitals, rising numbers of medical graduates, and a growing private sector have created an impression that quality healthcare is now within reach for all. Yet this perception masks the troubling truth that in countless remote villages across India, even a basic medical consultation remains out of reach. The closest doctor may be hours away, and trained nurses are often absent from the local primary health centre.&nbsp;</p>



<p>India’s rural healthcare system continues to fight the crisis of the acute shortage of trained human resources. Despite sustained government efforts and targeted interventions, the lack of doctors, nurses, and frontline workers in rural India remains one of the most critical barriers to delivering equitable care. Several interlocking factors explain why rural India remains on the wrong side of this imbalance.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Geographical maldistribution and urban preference&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Despite an overall increase in medical graduates over the year, recent surveys suggest that India has approximately <a href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=1581325" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">1:1456 of doctor-population ratio</a> contradicting the WHO standards of 1:1000. A key challenge lies in the urban concentration of medical professionals. Increasingly, doctors are opting for city-based careers, drawn by better professional opportunities, higher earning potential in the private sector, and superior living conditions. This growing urban preference has contributed to the persistent difficulty in staffing rural healthcare facilities leaving large swathes of India underserved and vulnerable.</p>



<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Unsupportive rural working conditions&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Persistent gaps in infrastructure such as unreliable electricity, limited access to clean water, inadequate staff housing, and non-functional diagnostic tools continue to plague rural healthcare systems in India. For doctors and medical personnel posted in remote areas, the lack of quality schooling for their children and the absence of secure, livable environments for both work and residence present additional barriers. These challenges collectively discourage healthcare workers from accepting or continuing rural postings, reinforcing the urban-rural divide in access to essential health services.</p>



<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Urban-centric medical education system&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Medical and nursing education in India remains largely centred around tertiary care, with limited emphasis on preparing professionals for the realities of rural practice. This urban-centric training leaves graduates ill-equipped and often unwilling to serve in underserved regions. Compounding the issue is the stark mismatch between the number of MBBS graduates and the availability of postgraduate seats, pushing many aspiring doctors to forego rural postings in pursuit of further academic opportunities—a trade-off that continues to weaken frontline care in rural India.</p>



<ol start="4" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Systemic delays and administrative inefficiencies&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Recruitment to India’s rural healthcare centres is often hindered by delayed processes, lack of transparent vacancy notifications, and bureaucratic red tape. These systemic inefficiencies not only slow down staffing but also deter many young medical professionals from applying to Primary Health Centres (PHCs) and Community Health Centres (CHCs), further deepening the rural health workforce crisis.</p>



<p>According to recent surveys, 65% of India’s total population lives in <a href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1894901#:~:text=The%20Survey%20notes%20that%2065,women%20and%20children%20have%20improved." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">rural areas</a>. Given this demographic reality, it is imperative to assess whether the country’s healthcare workforce aligns with the needs of its rural citizens.</p>



<p>Alarming data from the National Medical Journal of India indicates a shortfall of nearly <a href="https://nmji.in/view-pdf/?article=388b539aa87f7de466ae5d509bd03f00mRkcqV67lQc%3D" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">80% in rural healthcare staffing</a>, even as infrastructure has expanded. Since 2005, India has witnessed a 63.8% increase in the number of Community Health Centres (CHCs). As of 2022, there were 5,480 CHCs operational in rural areas, supplemented by 584 in urban settings. In tribal regions, 960 CHCs have been established, signalling a concerted effort to reach historically underserved populations.</p>



<p>Notably, states such as Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and Bihar have led the way in expanding healthcare infrastructure, reflecting targeted efforts to mitigate regional health disparities. However, infrastructure alone cannot deliver care without adequately trained and retained personnel, these centres risk becoming underutilised assets.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Public Health Chronicles</em>*</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-government-initiative-for-healthcare-in-india"><strong>Government initiative for healthcare in India </strong></h3>



<p>In alignment with Sustainable Development Goal 3 and India’s health priorities, the government is working to build a more inclusive and resilient healthcare system, especially in underserved regions. Recent reforms focus on strengthening frontline infrastructure, expanding workforce capacity, and leveraging digital solutions to close critical service gaps.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs):<br></strong>These centres provide comprehensive primary care including maternal and child services, NCD screenings, and essential medicines bringing preventive and promotive healthcare closer to rural communities.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>National Health Mission (NHM):</strong>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Launched in 2013, NHM integrates rural and urban health missions, emphasizing decentralized planning, community engagement, and system-wide improvements.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Human Resource Reforms:</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Using Rural Health Statistics to guide decisions, policy measures now target recruitment bottlenecks, workforce incentives, and training reforms to ensure skilled personnel reach India’s remotest health centres.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-human-resources-for-health-the-critical-pillar-of-indian-rural-healthcare"><strong>Human resources for health &#8211; The critical pillar of Indian rural healthcare</strong></h4>



<p>The World Health Organization defines the Human Resources for Health (HRH) as all individuals engaged in promoting, protecting or improving public health. It includes clinical care, public health interventions, research, management and support services. (WHO,2007). Their role and capacity directly influences health outcomes and system efficiency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When there is a&nbsp; <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11110446/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">low HRH density, </a>its direct impact is seen in increased maternal and child mortality, reduced life expectancy, and a growing burden of untreated mental health conditions. The shortage of healthcare givers in the rural landscape of India also becomes a concerning factor towards implementation of health policies to its full effect, disrupting continuity of care, and posing a significant barrier to achieving public health goals. Most critically, it threatens the country’s progress toward Universal Health Coverage.</p>



<p><strong>What&#8217;s needed? A people-first approach</strong></p>



<p>Like any profession, healthcare demands a robust, supportive ecosystem. One that nurtures not only clinical expertise but also professional development, career advancement, and personal well-being, especially in high-demand, resource-limited settings like rural India.</p>



<p>To address this systemic gap, health policy experts and medical academicians have put forward <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5789104/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">strategic recommendations</a> aimed at bridging the divide between trained healthcare providers and the underserved rural population. These include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Providing the medical personnels with rural healthcare fellowships programmes&nbsp;</li>



<li>Provide them with incentivised service models like housing, pay structure, and career recognitions&nbsp;</li>



<li>Strengthening community-based solutions by promoting the training of local women as ASHA workers and auxiliary nurse midwives</li>



<li>Digital upskilling and telemedicine integration</li>
</ul>



<p>These interventions recognise that rural health systems must be built from the ground up and not imposed from the top down. By encouraging local leadership, creating enabling conditions for healthcare professionals, and aligning incentives with service delivery, India can create solid, sustainable pathways for its rural health workforce.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-partnerships-that-strengthen-people-power-nbsp"><strong>Partnerships that strengthen people power&nbsp;</strong></h5>



<p>In the remote interiors of Tamil Nadu, a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLy35H0Powr/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">community of daily-wage labourers</a> survives on earnings that barely cover basic necessities. For them, healthcare was a luxury, an added financial strain they simply cannot afford.</p>



<p>However, that narrative has begun to shift. Through a strategic partnership with a leading multinational health technology firm, Smile Foundation’s <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Smile on Wheels</a> mobile medical unit now brings accessible, no-cost primary healthcare directly to their doorsteps.</p>



<p>Regular check-ups, preventive screenings, and free medicines have empowered pregnant women, children, and the elderly to take charge of their health without the anxiety of added financial burden.</p>



<p>This model demonstrates how targeted CSR partnerships can bridge systemic healthcare gaps, enabling low-resource populations to live healthier lives sustainably and with dignity.</p>



<p>Corporate Social Responsibility towards building a robust healthcare system is not a new phenomenon but definitely one of the most powerful tools to strengthen it. Since ages, corporate partnerships for healthcare have played a pivotal role in advancing the healthcare goals of the country bringing quality healthcare services and dignified lives to the underserved communities of India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, their role in solving the challenge of limited healthcare givers in India is more important to support and implement the initiatives taken by the state for a healthier India.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Support training of frontline workers in India’s rural healthcare system</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Training the rural healthcare workers strengthens community-based care, improves health outcomes and builds trust in the system. By investing time and efforts, corporate partnerships can empower women and children with better healthcare facilities, enhance workforce retention, and ensure sustained impact leading to compassion meeting the true potential of the frontline workforce in delivering quality healthcare.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Invest in technology enabled capacity building</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Technology driven solutions such as e-learning platforms, mobile medical units, and telehealth services extend the reach of quality care. These tools bridge access gaps, enable real time diagnostics, and foster last mile impact- transforming healthcare delivery for underserved communities while ensuring cost efficiency and positive impacts.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Partnering with NGOs in India to develop and deploy rural health talent pools&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>By partnering with trusted development organisations in India, corporates can enable scale deployment of trained health professionals in rural regions. These collaborations create sustainable talent pipelines, rooted in local context, ensuring continuity of care, community trust, and measurable healthy system strengthening at the base level.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Maternal anemia remains a silent crisis in India, affecting over half of pregnant women and jeopardising maternal and child health. Despite government efforts like Anemia Mukt Bharat, challenges in adherence, awareness, and nutrition persist. Smile Foundation’s community-driven approach through kitchen gardens, fortified foods, health camps, and peer counselling is bridging critical gaps. By empowering women with local solutions, the initiative transforms public health outcomes and nurtures stronger futures for mothers and their children.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Iron-folic acid (IFA) tablets are a cornerstone of India’s public health drive, but anemia remains a stubborn barrier to safe motherhood and healthy newborns. NFHS 5 data shows that 52.2% of pregnant women in India are anemic, and experts warn this widespread deficiency “contributes to high maternal and infant mortality rates”. Mothers who lack iron and nutrition are more likely to deliver low-birthweight or premature babies, and even mild anemia raises risks for both mother and child. Recognising this, the government’s Anemia Mukt Bharat strategy (2018) scaled up IFA supplements and nutrition counseling across the lifecycle. These efforts have helped millions, but by themselves they are not enough – pills must be backed by early diagnosis, education, and local action to make a real dent.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-government-efforts-and-the-community-gap"><strong>Government efforts and the community gap</strong></h2>



<p>India’s flagship IFA schemes for adolescents, and pregnant and lactating women are globally unmatched, and studies confirm iron supplementation is “the most efficient and scalable intervention” for anemia. Frontline workers including ASHA and Anganwadi workers distribute supplements and conduct awareness drives under Poshan Abhiyaan and <a href="https://nhm.gov.in/index1.php?lang=1&amp;level=3&amp;sublinkid=1448&amp;lid=797" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Anemia Mukt Bharat</a>. But in practice, tablets alone often fall short. Without counseling, many women skip doses or suffer side effects, and local diets remain poor in iron. Innovative local fixes can bridge this gap. For example, Sangrur (Punjab) officials found children were discarding morning IFA tablets. By mixing the iron dose into the mid-day meal and encouraging school kitchen gardens (spinach, fenugreek, etc.), they achieved 100% tablet intake and fresh nutrients. Smile Foundation’s work builds on such models, partnering with communities to translate policy into practice.</p>



<p>Smile Foundation’s programmes follow a systems approach that complements government infrastructure. Instead of relying on pills alone, we weave together multiple threads – from kitchen gardens and nutrition <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2608" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> to regular screening and counselling. Key components include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Kitchen gardens and food diversity:</strong> Schools and villages plant iron-rich veggies (spinach, legumes, moringa) so families have fresh iron sources year-round. In Sangrur, Smile helped grow dozens of community gardens.</li>



<li><strong>Regular <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2609" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> camps and screening:</strong> Mobile medical vans and local camps provide maternal-child check-ups and hemoglobin tests. In Mathura’s new “Pink Smile” initiative, fortnightly anemia camps reach thousands of women and girls.</li>



<li><strong>Nutrition education and fortified foods:</strong> Interactive sessions and recipe kits teach families how to use local foods for nutrition. In Gujarat’s Banaskantha, we distributed 15,000 fortified “laddoos” (iron-rich snacks) over 10 months alongside IFA tablets. More than 70% of the girls in that programme showed<strong> </strong>gains in hemoglobin and BMI.</li>



<li><strong>Adolescent and maternal counseling:</strong> Peer groups and home visits reinforce healthy behaviors. </li>



<li><strong>Capacity-building of local workers:</strong> Training Anganwadi staff and teachers ensures sustainability.</li>
</ul>



<p>These elements multiply impact by engaging the whole community.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sangrur-punjab-nutrition-enhancement-programme"><strong>Sangrur, Punjab: Nutrition Enhancement Programme</strong></h2>



<p>In Sangrur district, a three-year <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/adolescent-nutrition-is-at-the-heart-of-indias-development-agenda/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Nutrition Enhancement Programme</a> demonstrates the scale of this approach. It reached 23 villages and impacted over 60,000 people, including pregnant women, lactating mothers, and young children, plus their families. Through this effort, Smile teams and officials held 260 health camps offering nutrition and anemia screening. We also conducted nearly 9,750 community sessions and home visits on diet and self-care. The results have been encouraging – local officials report that anemia rates among school children plummeted from ~40.6% to just 2.7% within six months of the intervention. By coupling government resources (mid-day meals and IFA distribution) with kitchen gardens, counselors and camps, Sangrur has virtually eliminated anemia in some piloted schools – proof that ‘integration’ works.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mathura-uttar-pradesh-pink-smile"><strong>Mathura, Uttar Pradesh: Pink Smile</strong></h2>



<p>In Mathura’s rural Chatta Tehsil, Smile Foundation partnered with PepsiCo India on the recent <em>Pink Smile</em> project to tackle anemia and malnutrition in 10 villages. In its pilot phase, the programme has already reached 4,200 villagers (women, adolescents and children), and aims to cover over 40,000. Pink Smile brings together mobile medical vans, fortnightly anemia screening camps, and nutrition education. For example, local health teams distribute low-cost, high-nutrition recipes and food kits to pregnant women, set up kitchen garden kits for families, and train ASHAs on counselling methods. These hands-on, on-site services ensure early diagnosis and follow-up: anemia cases are caught at screening camps, treated promptly, and mothers receive regular dietary advice. This multi-pronged model – front-line care plus community nutrition – is designed to boost the impact of existing schemes by meeting people where they live.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-banaskantha-gujarat-project-sampoorna"><strong>Banaskantha, Gujarat: Project Sampoorna</strong></h2>



<p>Banaskantha is one of India’s Aspirational Districts and was the focus of Smile’s <em>Project Sampoorna</em>. Launched in 2018, Sampoorna worked with 1,000 adolescent girls (age 14–19) across 10 villages, all diagnosed with mild-to-severe anemia. Over 10 months, each girl received the special fortified laddoo twice a week, along with iron-folic tablets, multi-vitamins, and deworming as needed. Intensive education sessions taught the importance of iron-rich diets and kitchen gardening. The outcome was that the severe-to-moderate anemia in the group fell from ~78% to about 34%. Underweight prevalence dropped from 70.2% to just 13.8%, and girls in the “normal” BMI range rose from 29.5% to 86.1%. In practical terms, 70%+ of participants reported significantly better hemoglobin and body-mass index after the programme.</p>



<p>One girl’s story illustrates the human side of these numbers. Sahisa, a teenager from a village in Banaskantha, arrived at Sampoorna severely anemic and had even dropped out of school from fatigue. Through regular laddoos, supplements and close follow-up by Smile’s team, her health rebounded. Over a few months, she regained strength and energy. Sahisa returned to her village school and even enrolled in a vocational training course. Sahisa’s turnaround highlights that defeating anemia can literally turn lives around.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beyond-health-education-productivity-and-community-development"><strong>Beyond health: Education, productivity, and community development</strong></h3>



<p>The benefits of curing anemia reach far beyond hemoglobin levels. A well-nourished girl is more likely to stay in school, concentrate in class, and develop skills – boosting her future earning potential. Studies confirm this link: iron deficiency in childhood causes cognitive and physical delays that lead to “lower schooling and productivity loss” in adulthood. In practical terms, the gains seen in these projects have meant better school attendance and participation. Families also report that healthier mothers can care for their families and work more effectively. By improving nutrition and health, these programmes strengthen human capital: educated children, productive adults and ultimately stronger rural economies.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-systems-approach-amplifies-public-health"><strong>A systems approach amplifies public health</strong></h3>



<p>Taken together, the experience in Punjab, UP and Gujarat shows that community-led solutions reinforce the public health system and amplify government efforts like Anemia Mukt Bharat by adding local ownership and continuous follow-up. Tackling maternal and neonatal anemia demands a systems approach, one that combines government resources with grassroots engagement.</p>



<p>India’s anemia programmes have always been built on IFA supplementation and allied public health services – and rightly so. By adding regular community screenings, kitchen gardens, nutrition education and adolescent engagement to the national IFA drive, programmes like Smile Foundation’s are bridging the gap between policy and practice. These integrated projects keep families and local leaders involved, reinforce health workers’ efforts, and link wellbeing to tangible gains. The result is that young women like Sahisa emerge not only anemic-free but empowered – a generation of healthier mothers and workers in the making. In the battle for maternal and child health, fighting anaemia at its roots transforms what was once a silent crisis into an opportunity for social and economic progress.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you think healthcare is about doctors, prescriptions and the occasional hospital visit, think again. For millions across India, especially those on the margins, health means much more than treating illnesses. It’s about dignity, support and the chance to live without fear.</p>



<p>Take Mamtha, for instance. She’s elderly and works breaking stones to support her paralysed husband. Despite her own bodily diseases, she keeps going. For a long time, neither of them had access to regular medical care. But then a mobile medical unit run by Smile Foundation started visiting their village. Suddenly, Mamtha wasn’t invisible anymore. She had a doctor who listened, medicines that helped and a reason to believe things could get better.</p>



<p>Or consider Sarita Devi, who lost her home and her son. Living alone and frequently unwell, she had few people to turn to. Struggling with chronic illness and emotional trauma, she felt abandoned until the same mobile unit brought care right to her doorstep.</p>



<p>These stories are reflections of a healthcare system that often misses those who need it most. And they’re reminders that true healthcare is not just about treating illnesses but meeting people where they are, understanding their realities and building a system that supports them holistically.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-health-is-more-than-treating-illnesses"><strong>Health is more than treating illnesses </strong></h2>



<p>In policy circles, we often talk about health in technical terms – mortality rates, hospital beds per capita, insurance coverage. But in everyday life, health is far more intimate. It’s whether you have the strength to go to work. Whether your elderly mother can walk to the bathroom without pain. Whether your child can focus in school instead of battling a persistent fever.</p>



<p>For vulnerable communities, especially in rural and underserved urban areas, even basic healthcare can feel out of reach. Clinics are too far. Hospitals are overcrowded. And private care is prohibitively expensive. What’s left is often neglect – until things spiral into emergencies.</p>



<p>That’s where mobile healthcare models like <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Smile on Wheels</a></strong> come in. These aren’t just vans with stethoscopes. They’re fully equipped units staffed with doctors, nurses and health educators who offer both curative and preventive care. More importantly, they offer trust and a relationship with communities that builds over time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-trust-one-visit-at-a-time"><strong>Building trust, one visit at a time</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/smile-foundation_healthcannotwait-activity-7352216425723277314-4thC/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADgTDtkB93yU-Rhkq6MtWdjk8CU8K1895Uw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Dr Mahesh, Smile Foundation’s medical officer</a>, believes in this every day. He reaches people who have little or no access to medical support. From simple check-ups to patient listening, he brings comfort and awareness to many. As part of <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Smile on Wheels</a>, each day in different localities, he aims to provide comprehensive health coverage for people. From preventive <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2655" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> to regular check-ups, the programme offers a full package and is not just about treating illnesses. Smile on Wheels focuses on three A&#8217;s: availability, affordability and accessibility. It helps build trust between Smile’s team and the community. </p>



<p>Trust isn’t built overnight. But when healthcare workers show up consistently, speak the local language and treat patients with respect, people open up and they follow up too. They begin to see healthcare not as a last resort, but as a normal part of life.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-preventive-care-matters"><strong>Why preventive care matters</strong></h3>



<p>We tend to associate healthcare with crisis—surgery after an accident, IV drips after dengue, antibiotics after infection. But by then, the damage is often done. What’s needed is a shift in how we think about healthcare.</p>



<p>Preventive care – things like screenings, vaccinations, nutrition counselling and health education – keep small problems from becoming big ones. They cost less, require fewer resources and most importantly, reduce suffering.</p>



<p>Smile Foundation integrates preventive care into its mobile clinics. Health workers run regular sessions on hygiene, nutrition, menstrual health and common chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension. These sessions are especially impactful for women, who are often primary caregivers but lack information about their own health.</p>



<p>When people know what to watch for, and where to go when symptoms show up, they’re less likely to wait until it’s too late.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mental-and-emotional-health-can-t-be-an-afterthought"><strong>Mental and emotional health can’t be an afterthought</strong></h3>



<p>We often forget that healthcare is not just physical. Emotional and mental health matter too, especially for the elderly, the isolated and the traumatised.</p>



<p>In India, mental health remains deeply stigmatised, particularly in low-income communities. But people like Mamtha and Sarita show us why it can’t be ignored. Chronic stress, grief and loneliness take a toll on the body and the mind. Left unaddressed, they can make recovery harder and illness more persistent.</p>



<p>Smile Foundation incorporates emotional support into its health model. Counsellors and social workers provide not just information, but companionship. Sometimes, that means guiding someone through grief. Other times, it means just listening – really listening – to someone who hasn’t felt heard in years.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-access-is-the-first-step-but-it-s-not-the-only-one"><strong>Access is the first step, but it’s not the only one</strong></h3>



<p>Access is foundational. If people can’t physically reach care, or can’t afford it, nothing else matters. But access alone for treating illnesses doesn’t guarantee quality or continuity.</p>



<p>That’s why mobile healthcare needs to be more than just an emergency stop-gap. Smile on Wheels offers post-consultation follow-ups, chronic disease management and even referrals to secondary and tertiary care where needed.</p>



<p>For example, someone with high blood pressure isn’t just handed medication and sent away. They’re educated about diet and lifestyle changes. They’re checked on regularly. Their data is recorded, monitored and analysed to spot risks early.</p>



<p>This kind of consistent, community-rooted care is what transforms healthcare from a service into a system.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-policy-gaps-and-the-role-of-non-state-actors"><strong>Policy gaps and the role of non-state actors</strong></h3>



<p>India’s health policy has made real progress over the last two decades. The National Health Mission, Ayushman Bharat and state-level initiatives have expanded infrastructure and access. But public health systems remain stretched, especially in hard-to-reach areas.</p>



<p>This is where civil society and NGOs like Smile Foundation play a critical role. They act as bridges between state infrastructure and ground-level realities. Between technology and trust. Between diagnosis and dignity.</p>



<p>Our work offers a model that policymakers should study more closely. Community health delivery doesn’t have to mean building more hospitals. It can mean equipping vans, training local health workers and investing in systems that adapt to where people are, not the other way around.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-comprehensive-healthcare-can-also-look-like"><strong>What comprehensive healthcare can also look like</strong></h3>



<p>As India moves toward becoming a $5 trillion economy, we can’t afford to leave millions behind when it comes to health. True progress is measured not just by GDP or hospital chains, but by whether Mamtha and Sarita Devi can live with dignity.</p>



<p>So, what should we be aiming for?</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A health system that sees people, not just patients.</li>



<li>Infrastructure that reaches beyond cities and into forgotten lanes.</li>



<li>Prevention that is as much a priority as cure.</li>



<li>Mental health support built into primary care.</li>



<li>Policies that invest in trust, not just in technology.</li>
</ul>



<p>Healthcare isn’t just about curing what’s broken. It’s about keeping people whole.</p>



<p>And as Smile Foundation’s Smile on Wheels programme shows, that starts with showing up – day after day, village after village – and reminding people that they matter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the pursuit of better public health, few tools are as powerful, cost-effective, and long-lasting as education. While medicine treats illness, education prevents it. Particularly in the case of common infectious and non-communicable diseases, health education provided early and often can determine whether children and their families thrive or survive. For millions across India, especially in low-resource and rural communities, education has the potential to be the first line of defence against disease.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-education-and-health-an-interconnected-reality-for-preventing-common-diseases"><strong>Education and health: An interconnected reality</strong> <strong>for preventing common diseases</strong></h2>



<p>Health and education are deeply intertwined, influencing not only individual well-being but the development trajectory of entire nations. As two of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being and SDG 4: Quality Education), their alignment is both urgent and necessary. Individuals with higher levels of education tend to have <a href="https://archpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13690-020-00402-5" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">better health outcomes</a>, longer lifespans, and greater access to preventive care. A 2020 study published in <em>The Lancet Public Health</em> found that each additional year of education reduces the risk of early mortality by 2%. More educated adults are also less likely to smoke, more likely to exercise, and better able to understand health information.</p>

<p>This linkage is especially critical for women. Educated women are significantly more likely to seek maternal care, follow immunisation schedules for their children, and access early treatment for illnesses. Education, therefore, does not only benefit the individual but reshapes the health outlook for entire families and communities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-school-as-a-health-enabler-for-preventing-common-diseases"><strong>The school as a health enabler</strong> <strong>for preventing common diseases</strong></h2>



<p>Schools, where children spend the majority of their formative years, are natural platforms for delivering health education. They are not just spaces of academic learning but of behavioural formation. When integrated thoughtfully, school-based health education helps inculcate habits that leads to preventing common diseases and supporting lifelong well-being.</p>



<p>Key areas where schools contribute include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Hygiene and Sanitation:</strong> Teaching handwashing, menstrual hygiene, and safe toilet practices directly reduces the spread of diarrhoeal diseases, respiratory infections, and skin conditions.</li>



<li><strong>Nutrition and Physical Activity:</strong> Schools that promote healthy eating and physical activity can counter rising childhood obesity, undernutrition, and associated risks like diabetes.</li>



<li><strong>Mental Health Awareness:</strong> Adolescence is often when early signs of mental illness appear. School counselling, peer support groups, and social-emotional learning (SEL) can reduce stigma and provide crucial early support.</li>



<li><strong>Sexual and Reproductive Health:</strong> Comprehensive sexuality education helps prevent adolescent pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) while encouraging informed, respectful relationships.</li>
</ul>



<p>By embedding these themes into daily routines and learning environments, schools can function as health equalizers, particularly in disadvantaged areas.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-preventing-common-diseases-through-understanding"><strong>Preventing common diseases through understanding</strong></h3>



<p>Children are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases such as the flu, measles, chickenpox, and diarrhoea due to developing immune systems and frequent close contact in shared spaces. These diseases often spread through airborne droplets, contaminated surfaces, or poor sanitation. Education empowers children to recognise symptoms, understand transmission routes, and adopt preventive behaviours.</p>



<p>For example, hand hygiene alone can reduce the incidence of diarrhoea by up to 40%. Yet such practices are only sustained when reinforced through consistent education and supportive environments.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bridging-the-health-gap-in-underserved-communities"><strong>Bridging the health gap in underserved communities</strong></h3>



<p>For children in rural or low-income areas, where healthcare services are sparse or unaffordable, schools may represent the only access point to health information and support. This is where community-focused interventions become vital.</p>



<p>Smile Foundation exemplifies how education and health can work hand in hand to reduce disease burdens. Through integrated programmes across the country, we educate children and families about disease prevention, hygiene, nutrition, and mental health.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smile-foundation-s-health-education-interventions"><strong>Smile Foundation’s health education interventions</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Mission Education</a>:</strong> This flagship initiative not only imparts academic learning but also integrates health awareness into daily schooling. Children are taught about personal hygiene, handwashing, nutrition, and preventive practices for communicable diseases.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Smile on Wheels</a>:</strong> A mobile hospital programme that brings healthcare and health education to remote and urban underserved communities. It conducts regular health camps, where doctors and health educators provide treatment and awareness sessions on preventing common illnesses such as diarrhoea, dengue, and skin infections.</li>



<li><strong>WASH initiatives in schools:</strong> Smile Foundation runs behaviour change campaigns focused on Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), reinforcing hygiene through wall art, child-led hygiene clubs, and interactive sessions in schools.</li>



<li><strong>Training frontline workers:</strong> Smile also trains ASHAs, ANMs, and CHOs to become effective communicators of health information in their communities, ensuring the reach of preventive education beyond classrooms.</li>



<li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> Health camps and awareness drives often involve parents, thereby creating a ripple effect in local communities. <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/parent-teacher-connection-in-india/" title="Parent-Teacher Teamwork in Child Development" data-wpil-monitor-id="2603" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Smile’s model reinforces that educating one child</a> can educate a household.</li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-policy-alignment-and-national-programmes"><strong>Policy alignment and national programmes</strong></h3>



<p>India has recognised the role of education in promoting health through national programmes such as:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>The School Health Programme under Ayushman Bharat</strong>, which designates teachers as Health and Wellness Ambassadors to promote disease prevention in classrooms.</li>



<li><strong>UNICEF’s WASH in Schools</strong> and <strong>WHO’s Global School Health Initiative</strong>, which advocate globally for improved hygiene practices and health education in learning environments.</li>
</ul>



<p>These initiatives, combined with grassroots models like those of Smile Foundation, are essential to ensuring health equity and building community resilience.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-awareness-to-agency"><strong>From awareness to agency</strong></h3>



<p>Ultimately, education does more than inform. It empowers. A child who learns the importance of vaccination is more likely to complete immunisation schedules. A girl who understands reproductive health is better equipped to make safe decisions. A student who knows the signs of mental distress is more likely to seek help.</p>



<p>When communities are educated, they are not passive recipients of aid, but active participants in health governance. They demand services, hold systems accountable, and foster collective well-being.</p>



<p>In this light, education is not an adjunct to healthcare—it is its most foundational layer.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-call-to-strengthen-the-link"><strong>A call to strengthen the link</strong></h3>



<p>The goal of universal health coverage cannot be achieved through medical interventions alone. It must be underpinned by widespread, inclusive, and consistent health education, starting with our schools.</p>



<p>Investments in school health programmes, <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/strategic-shared-value-csr-tax-benefits-for-business-society/" title="Strategic Shared Value: CSR Tax Benefits for Business &amp; Society" data-wpil-monitor-id="2602" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">partnerships with civil society actors like Smile</a> Foundation, and curriculum reforms that include comprehensive health education are not just good policy; they are necessary strategies to protect the health of the next generation.</p>



<p>In a post-pandemic world that has exposed the fragility of health systems and the power of prevention, India has a clear opportunity to place education at the heart of its public health mission.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Over 65% of India’s population lives in rural areas, but healthcare infrastructure and personnel remain disproportionately urban-centric. Punjab’s rural communities, home to ~17.9 million people, face a 20% shortfall in health sub-centres, fewer Primary Health Centres (PHCs) than needed, and a huge gap in Community Health Centres (CHCs)<strong>.</strong> As a result, each rural sub-centre in Punjab serves on average 6,258 people (vs the national norm of 5,000) and each PHC covers 45,000 people (vs norm 30,000). These shortages are compounded by severe workforce gaps – for instance, rural CHCs in Punjab have <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/punjabs-healthcare-crisis-insufficient-facilities-and-doctor-shortage/articleshow/113376848.cms#:~:text=%2852,lives%20in%20the%20rural%20areas" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">only 55 specialist doctors</a> against 336 required (over 80% vacancy).</p>



<p>Many facilities also lack basics like electricity and water: in 2023, 299 of Punjab’s 2,857 rural sub-centres had no electric supply and dozens lacked running water. This infrastructure deficit undermines service quality and deters healthcare utilisation, especially among vulnerable groups (women, children, the elderly). It reflects a broader inequity. </p>



<p>Globally, 56% of people in rural areas do not have access to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213398424001805#:~:text=,access%20to%20essential%20healthcare%20services" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">essential health services</a>, contributing to worse health outcomes and avoidable mortality. Bridging these gaps in accessibility is crucial for India’s commitment to Universal <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2527" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Health</a> Coverage (UHC) and health equity.</p>



<p>Telemedicine has emerged as an effective solution to the rural healthcare crisis, by breaking geographical barriers and bringing medical expertise virtually to underserved areas. India’s national telemedicine platform <strong>eSanjeevani</strong> exemplifies this potential – since launching in 2019, it has facilitated <a href="https://m.economictimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/healthcare/over-34-crore-patients-provided-consultation-through-esanjeevani-platform-rajya-sabha-told/articleshow/118149172.cms#:~:text=Since%20its%20launch%20in%202019%2C,said%20responding%20to%20a%20question" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">over 34 crore (340 million) consultations</a> as of Feb 2025, connecting remote patients with doctors and specialists. </p>



<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine proved indispensable in maintaining care continuity in remote regions. The Government’s two-pronged eSanjeevani system – AB-HWC (Ayushman Bharat-Health and Wellness Centre) for provider-to-provider consultations via Community Health Officers (CHOs) at rural clinics, and OPD for direct patient-to-doctor online visits – has helped ensure availability, accessibility and affordability of healthcare across India. However, leveraging telehealth at scale also requires robust digital infrastructure, training, and community trust. Studies indicate that without adequate training and protocols, telemedicine referrals can be sub-optimal, and limited digital literacy or connectivity in rural areas remains a barrier. Addressing these challenges is essential to realise telemedicine’s full impact. </p>



<p>Punjab, with relatively high mobile penetration and improving broadband reach, is well-positioned to benefit from telehealth innovations – provided the rural clinics are upgraded with power supply, internet, and skilled staff. This is the context in which Smile Foundation’s telemedicine initiative in Moga district, Punjab, was conceived as a public-private partnership model to strengthen rural primary care delivery.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smile-foundation-telemedicine-initiative-in-moga-punjab"><strong>Smile Foundation telemedicine initiative in Moga, Punjab</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Moga, Punjab</strong> – identified under India’s Aspirational Blocks Programme for its lagging health indicators became the focus of a telemedicine-led healthcare strengthening project in 2023-24. Smile Foundation, in collaboration with the Health Department of Punjab, and corporate partner SBI Cards, launched a comprehensive telemedicine initiative to bolster primary <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/resolving-remote-rural-healthcare-needs-through-static-clinics/" title="Resolving Remote Rural Healthcare Needs Through Static Clinics" data-wpil-monitor-id="2605" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">healthcare in Moga’s rural</a> blocks. This model builds on Smile Foundation’s prior success in <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/telemedicine-project-in-nuh-haryana-easing-healthcare-access/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Nuh (Haryana)</a>, adapting it to local needs in Punjab. </p>



<p>The project’s core intervention is the establishment of <strong>12 e-Arogya Telemedicine Clinics</strong> at government Health and Wellness Centres (sub-centres) across Moga. Each clinic is equipped with a telemedicine kiosk, digital diagnostics (point-of-care devices), and a Medicine Vending Machine (MVM) for instant dispensing of essential drugs prescribed during tele-consultations. Crucially, the project invested in <strong>infrastructure upgrades</strong> and identified sub-centres were refurbished along with outfitting of solar power units in them to ensure 24×7 electricity, and providing reliable internet connectivity to support uninterrupted tele-consultation sessions. This approach directly addressed the basic facility gaps, like electricity, that previously hindered digital health services in Punjab’s villages. </p>

<p>By December 2023, necessary government approvals were obtained and the telemedicine units were integrated with the national <strong>eSanjeevani</strong> platform, aligning the project with the Ministry of Health’s digital health ecosystem.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-capacity-building-and-community-engagement"><strong>Capacity-building and community engagement</strong></h3>



<p>Capacity-building and community engagement form a major pillar of the Moga initiative. In partnership with state authorities, Smile Foundation conducted training for local healthcare providers and Frontline Workers. In late 2024, a two-day training for <strong>180 frontline staff (CHOs, ANMs, ASHAs)</strong> from Moga’s health centres was held, focusing on management of common Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) like hypertension, diabetes, and screening for breast, cervical, and oral cancers. This skilling-up of workers aimed to ensure they can effectively use the telemedicine equipment, triage patients, and promote continuity of care. </p>

<p>“Strengthening healthcare at the grassroots” also involved behaviour change communication in the community – health awareness camps, village meetings, and mobilisation by ASHA workers to increase acceptance of teleconsultation services. The programme specifically targets women and marginalised groups for outreach, in line with Smile’s <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/donation/women-empowerment" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Swabhiman</a> (women’s empowerment) programme.</strong> Notably, Dr. Neena Bansal, Senior Medical Officer in Moga, commended the initiative and presented a Certificate of Appreciation to Smile Foundation for its contribution to upgrading rural Health and Wellness Centres.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/1728451625659-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13955" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/1728451625659-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/1728451625659-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/1728451625659-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/1728451625659-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/1728451625659.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>By early 2025, the e-Arogya clinics in Moga have begun offering remote consultations with MBBS doctors and specialists (located at hub hospitals) via eSanjeevani, free medication for patients through the MVM linked to government supply, and routine NCD risk-factor screenings – bringing primary care delivery that normally required travel to district hospitals directly to villages.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-improved-primary-care-delivery-and-health-access-outcomes"><strong>Improved primary care delivery and health access outcomes</strong></h2>



<p>Though the Moga telemedicine project is in its early stages, it draws from the proven impact of Smile Foundation’s earlier telehealth intervention in Nuh district, Haryana which offers a template for expected outcomes. Nuh, a predominantly rural and socio-economically challenged area (ranked among India’s Aspirational Districts), saw its first Smile telemedicine unit launched in May 2021. By mid-2023, this had expanded to 10 e-Arogya clinics across 8 PHC areas in Nuh, covering a population of about 10 lakh (1 million). The results have been remarkable in enhancing healthcare utilisation and equity. </p>



<p>In a one-year period (April 2022–March 2023), Nuh’s telemedicine centres facilitated 32,789 doctor consultations for villagers who otherwise face barriers to access. Importantly, over 53% of patients were repeat users (multiple visits), indicating high satisfaction and trust in the quality of care. The telemedicine clinics also integrated NCD screenings into their workflow, leading to thousands being screened for diabetes, hypertension, and other conditions per government protocols, with data reported into the public health system for follow-up. Such integration with the national NCD programme means earlier detection and referral of cases (e.g. identifying hypertensive patients who were unaware of their condition), reinforcing primary care’s gatekeeping role.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gender-equity-impact"><strong>Gender-equity impact</strong></h3>



<p>Critically, the Nuh <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/csr-partnership-today-shaping-a-future-for-people-planet-profit/" title="CSR Partnership Today: Shaping a Future for People, Planet &amp; Profit" data-wpil-monitor-id="2604" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">model demonstrated a gender-equity impact</a>. Of the 35,000+ individuals directly benefitting from the telemedicine clinics in Nuh’s first two years, <strong>52% were women</strong> – a notable achievement in a conservative region where women’s healthcare-seeking outside the home was very limited. Community women who “could not think of going outside the village” for care were now comfortably accessing medical consultations virtually in their local clinic. This reflects how telemedicine can overcome socio-cultural barriers by providing primary care delivery in a familiar setting. Patients received not only primary consultations but also referral support: the telehealth system in Nuh is linked with higher centres – about 2–3% of cases each quarter were referred to secondary/tertiary hospitals for issues needing in-person intervention, with the telemedicine staff facilitating these referrals. By managing the bulk of routine ailments and follow-ups at village level, the project helped decongest higher hospitals and cut down out-of-pocket expenditures (e.g. travel costs) for the community. Local health officials in Nuh noted a visible increase in outpatient footfall at the upgraded sub-centres due to telemedicine and NCD services, which in turn meant earlier treatment and better monitoring of chronic conditions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-strengthening-of-the-public-health-system"><strong>Strengthening of the public health system</strong></h3>



<p>Another key outcome from Nuh has been the strengthening of the public health system through collaboration. The telemedicine units were eventually integrated into the government’s eSanjeevani network and handed over to the District Health Administration for sustainable operations. All 10 units in Nuh are now run as part of the Ayushman Bharat-Health and Wellness Centre scheme, with trained CHOs managing the teleconsultations – effectively institutionalising the innovation. This sustainability plan was built in by Smile Foundation from the start: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“We focus on setting up telemedicine clinics under a PPP model and later handing them over to the government to operate,”</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>noted Mr. Santanu Mishra, Co-Founder of Smile Foundation. </p>



<p>Indeed, the Nuh telemedicine project was recognised nationally, winning the <strong>ASSOCHAM “Best <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" title="Corporate Partnerships" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2528" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">CSR</a> Excellence in Healthcare” Award in 2023</strong> for its impact in an aspirational district. Punjab’s Moga initiative is following the same trajectory. Initial indications show improved health awareness and service uptake in target villages of Moga. The project has set quarterly targets (e.g. ~4,300 teleconsultations per quarter by late 2024, scaling to ~10,000+ per quarter by late 2025), and will similarly be evaluated on reductions in patient travel, better management of NCDs, and patient satisfaction. Already, the collaborative training and enhanced infrastructure have prepared Moga’s health sub-centres to function as “model health and wellness centres”, offering a broader range of services than before.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-toward-equitable-and-scalable-primary-care-delivery-models"><strong>Toward equitable and scalable <strong>primary care delivery</strong> models</strong></h2>



<p>The telemedicine model in Moga, and previously in Nuh, highlights how digital health can catalyse equitable healthcare delivery when combined with investments in primary care and community engagement. These interventions directly contribute to national health goals and international targets. By bringing doctors to the remotest communities virtually, such projects are “ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages,” advancing <strong>Sustainable Development Goal 3 on health</strong>. They operationalise the Indian government’s vision under the National Health Policy 2017 and Ayushman Bharat: namely, leveraging digital technology to increase access, improve quality, and reduce the cost of healthcare delivery. </p>



<p>The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) provides a supportive framework for interoperability and electronic health records, which the Moga telemedicine clinics are utilising to generate digital health records and share data on NCDs with state systems. Notably, Moga’s inclusion in the Aspirational Blocks Programme means it receives coordinated support to uplift health indicators – WHO India is one of the partners in this effort, focusing on primary health care strengthening and capacity building in Punjab’s aspirational blocks. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-power-of-public-private-partnership-ppp-model"><strong>The power of public-private partnership (PPP) model</strong></h3>



<p>Smile Foundation initiative dovetails with this by addressing service delivery gaps on the ground. It demonstrates a scalable public-private partnership (PPP) model: the private sector (NGO and CSR funding) innovates and pilots the service, while the public sector provides facilities, integrates the services into its schemes, and sustains them long-term. Such models can be replicated in other under-served districts and blocks. Indeed, the Government of India is expanding telehealth through eSanjeevani to all 1.5 lakh Health and Wellness Centres nationally, learning from these pilots.</p>



<p>Digital infrastructure is now recognised as a critical determinant of health access. Moga’s project showed that investing in basics like power and internet connectivity for rural clinics is a pre-requisite to digital health solutions – a lesson for scalability. As rural broadband improves under programmes like BharatNet, telemedicine’s reach will further expand. However, human infrastructure is just as important: continuous training for health workers, digital literacy for patients, and trust-building in communities are vital for success. The Moga initiative’s use of local language educational materials and involving community leaders (Panchayats, village health committees) has been key to winning acceptance – villagers see the telemedicine clinic as an extension of the public health system, not a foreign technology. This community-centric approach aligns with WHO’s emphasis on people-centred primary care and reducing rural-urban health disparities. The World Economic Forum has lauded India’s digital health progress, noting that &#8220;telemedicine platforms are overcoming geographical barriers and reaching remote populations with quality care, thus bridging healthcare disparities.&#8221;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reaching-the-last-mile"><strong>Reaching the last mile</strong></h3>



<p>In conclusion, Smile Foundation’s telemedicine initiative in Moga, Punjab exemplifies a data-driven, collaborative strategy to strengthen rural health systems. Early evidence and comparative insights from Nuh indicate that such interventions can substantially improve health system accessibility, by providing “last-mile” connectivity for medical services, enhance primary healthcare delivery through comprehensive services at the community level, and build digital health infrastructure that leaves a lasting impact. With supportive policy integration, these models contribute to a more equitable healthcare framework – one where a villager in Moga or Nuh can access timely, quality medical advice as readily as someone in a city. </p>



<p>As Punjab and India at large work towards universal health coverage, scaling up successful telemedicine-public health hybrids could very well be a game-changer for underserved regions. The Moga telemedicine project, supported by multi-sectoral partnerships and aligned with national programmes, is not only delivering care today but also providing a <strong>proof-of-concept for sustainable, tech-enabled primary healthcare</strong> that can be reproduced across India’s aspirational districts and beyond. </p>



<p>By addressing both the supply-side (infrastructure, providers) and demand-side (community awareness, affordability) barriers, it charts a path toward bridging the rural health divide and ensuring that geography is no longer destiny when it comes to primary care delivery access.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Pregnancy and childbirth are often described as magical, life-changing experiences—and they are. But what comes after can be just as intense, just as transformative, and often, not talked about enough.</p>



<p>Once the baby arrives, attention naturally shifts to the newborn. But a mother’s journey is far from over. In fact, it&#8217;s just entering a new chapter. The postpartum period, those first weeks and months after delivery, is a time of physical healing, emotional recalibration, and massive change. And yet, many women feel completely unprepared for it.</p>



<p>Let’s talk about what really happens during postpartum, why it matters, and how more open, informed conversations can help women feel seen, supported, and better equipped to take care of themselves.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-physical-side-what-your-body-goes-through-after-birth"><strong>The physical side: What your body goes through after birth</strong></h2>



<p>No one really tells you how physically demanding postpartum recovery can be. Sure, childbirth is tough but what happens afterward can be equally intense.</p>



<p>For starters, your uterus doesn’t just shrink back immediately. It takes weeks to return to its normal size, and the contractions that help it get there can cause cramping that feels like strong period pain. This is completely normal but often catches women by surprise.</p>



<p>Then there&#8217;s <strong><a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/22485-lochia#:~:text=What%20is%20lochia%3F-,Lochia%20is%20the%20vaginal%20discharge%20you%20have%20after%20giving%20birth,flow%20until%20it%20goes%20away." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">lochia</a></strong>, a heavy vaginal discharge made up of blood and tissue, which can continue for up to six weeks. Many women aren’t prepared for the amount or duration of postpartum bleeding and that can be unsettling if they don’t know what to expect.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/labor-and-delivery/in-depth/postpartum-care/art-20047233" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Vaginal soreness</a></strong> is also common, especially for those who had a vaginal delivery. Swelling, discomfort in the perineal area, and stinging while urinating can linger for days or even weeks. Ice packs, warm baths, and prescribed pain relief can help, but the healing process is personal and varies greatly from woman to woman.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.unicef.org/parenting/food-nutrition/5-common-breastfeeding-problems" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Breastfeeding</a> brings another set of challenges. Breasts can feel swollen, tender, or painfully engorged. Cracked nipples, latching issues, and early breastfeeding discomfort are more common than most admit. And while nursing is often portrayed as natural and bonding, it doesn’t always come easily. Many mothers find the process frustrating, even distressing.</p>



<p>On top of that, hormone fluctuations, interrupted sleep, and the sheer exhaustion of caring for a newborn can leave women drained, both physically and emotionally.</p>



<p>This is why postpartum <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2504" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> is so crucial. New mothers need to be informed about what’s normal, what’s not, and when to seek help. Unfortunately, in many parts of India, and especially in rural or underserved communities, this kind of information just isn’t readily available.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-closing-the-gap-making-postpartum-care-accessible"><strong>Closing the gap: Making postpartum care accessible</strong></h2>



<p>Healthcare providers are doing their best, but time, infrastructure, and access are often limited. That’s where non-profits step in to fill critical gaps.</p>



<p>Smile Foundation is working to change that narrative. Through our <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/donation/women-empowerment" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Swabhiman</a> </strong>programme, we conduct awareness sessions that empower women with information about postpartum health—from hygiene to nutrition to newborn care. These sessions not only educate but also encourage women to seek care without shame or delay.</p>



<p>In areas where clinics are few and far between, Smile Foundation’s <strong>Smile on Wheels</strong> initiative brings healthcare right to women’s doorsteps. These mobile medical units, staffed with doctors and paramedics, provide essential maternal and child <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2503" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> services, including check-ups, basic diagnostics, and medications—free of cost.</p>



<p>By reaching women who might otherwise fall through the cracks, these initiatives play a vital role in building a more equitable healthcare system and improving maternal outcomes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-emotional-wellness-the-part-we-don-t-talk-about-enough"><strong>Emotional Wellness: The part we don’t talk about enough</strong></h2>



<p>While the physical changes are more visible, the emotional toll of postpartum can be just as significant—if not more so. Yet it often goes unacknowledged.</p>



<p>Many new mothers experience the “baby blues” in the first few days after birth. These mood swings, tearfulness, and irritability are usually short-lived. But when feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or anxiety persist, it could be something more serious: <strong>Postpartum Depression (PPD)</strong>.</p>



<p>PPD affects between <strong>10 to 20 percent of women</strong> after childbirth. It’s not simply about feeling tired or overwhelmed. Women with PPD may experience emotional numbness, chronic fatigue, trouble bonding with their baby, sleep and appetite disturbances, and even thoughts of self-harm or harming their child.</p>



<p>PPD can begin a few weeks after delivery, or it might take months to show up. Either way, it&#8217;s real, it’s serious, and it’s treatable. What’s needed is early identification and support through therapy, medication when needed, or a combination of both.</p>



<p>Again, awareness plays a huge role here. Smile Foundation has also stepped up in this space, conducting outreach and educational programmes focused on maternal mental health, breastfeeding education, and nutritional care. These programmes are designed not just to inform but to empower women to recognise when they need help and to feel safe asking for it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-talking-about-postpartum-matters"><strong>Why talking about postpartum matters</strong></h2>



<p>The postpartum period is not just about recovery—it’s a time of rediscovery. A woman’s identity is reshaped as she learns to care for a newborn while also navigating pain, fatigue, hormonal shifts, and social expectations.</p>



<p>Yet, conversations about postpartum tend to be hushed or wrapped in guilt and pressure—to bounce back, to keep smiling, to just “be grateful.” The result? Many women feel isolated, overwhelmed, or even ashamed of their struggles.</p>



<p>Changing this starts with acknowledging the full picture. By speaking openly about the physical and emotional realities of postpartum, we make it easier for women to share, to seek support, and to trust that what they’re feeling is valid.</p>

<p>Postpartum care shouldn’t be a privilege. It should be a standard part of every mother’s healthcare journey. That means:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Providing clear, consistent information before and after delivery.</li>



<li>Offering mental health support without stigma.</li>



<li>Making maternal health services available and accessible, no matter where a woman lives.</li>

<p>Motherhood is powerful, but it’s also vulnerable. And women shouldn’t have to navigate that vulnerability alone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Every day, truck drivers—unsung heroes who deliver everything from food and medicine to the smartphones in our pockets—power the Indian economy. However, the life of a truck driver remains arduous and largely unknown. Long hours behind the wheel, irregular rest, poor posture, and inactivity all contribute to chronic pain, joint strain, and long-term musculoskeletal disorders, coupled with poor working conditions, little access to nutritious food and adequate healthcare takes a significant and often invisible toll on their physical and mental well-being. Yet, most seek help only when the pain becomes debilitating—too late for simple solutions. For many, the physical toll results in a steady, silent deterioration of their health and <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" title="Livelihood" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2506" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">livelihood</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-their-injuries"><strong>Their injuries</strong></h2>



<p>The most common occupational injuries among professional drivers are <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/10/23/4492" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">musculoskeletal diseases (MSDs</a>) of the neck, back, and upper extremities. Drivers who miss work due to MSD-related injuries suffer not only physical suffering but also financial damages. According to studies, MSDs cause 33% of all occupational illnesses and injuries.</p>



<p>Here lies a powerful opportunity for corporate India, particularly stakeholders in logistics, retail, e-commerce, and manufacturing. Companies may develop a healthier, more resilient trucking workforce by investing in preventative physiotherapy as part of their <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" title="Corporate Partnerships" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2507" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">CSR</a> or wellness initiatives, as well as building ethical supply chains that care for people who keep them operating. HDB Financial Services (HDBFS) has established its <a href="https://thecsruniverse.com/articles/hdbfs-inaugurates-transport-aarogyam-kendra-to-support-truck-drivers-in-indore" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">seventh Transport Aarogyam Kendra (TAK)</a> in Indore, in collaboration with the Smile Foundation. TAK is a healthcare institution dedicated particularly to the well-being of truck drivers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Each TAK:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Offers free physiotherapy consultations and exercises for truckers.</li>



<li>Provides access to general health check-ups, eye exams, and lifestyle counselling.</li>



<li>Operates in transport hubs and logistics parks, ensuring easy access to drivers where they work and rest.</li>
</ul>



<p>Alongside these centres, Smile Foundation deploys its flagship <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Smile on Wheels</a> mobile medical units. These vans bring doctors, paramedics, diagnostic services, and free medicines directly to trucking zones and highways—ensuring healthcare is both accessible and continuous.</p>



<p>In just the last year, Smile Foundation’s mobile healthcare units have conducted thousands of physiotherapy sessions, delivered preventive care <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2505" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a>, and helped drivers identify and treat symptoms before they became severe. This kind of early intervention model is both scalable and sustainable.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-preventive-physiotherapy"><strong>What is preventive physiotherapy?</strong></h2>



<p>Preventive physiotherapy, with its focus on early posture correction and mobility, could break this cycle. It is a cheap and effective way to keep India&#8217;s truck drivers moving without discomfort. Instead of waiting for problems to develop, it identifies risk factors early and addresses them before they cause pain or injury. It can be as simple as a 10-minute stretch routine during refuelling breaks or periodic visits from mobile physiotherapy units. When done consistently, these small changes can reduce long-term injuries, improve stamina, and help drivers stay on the road—safely and sustainably. It’s not just about treatment. It’s about giving drivers a fighting chance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-corporate-india-should-step-in"><strong>Why corporate India should step in</strong></h2>



<p>India’s logistics engine depends on its truck drivers, yet their health remains dangerously neglected. Corporates— Businesses, especially those in e-commerce, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), and supply chain operations, need to change this for moral and strategic reasons. Companies who are ahead of the curve know that <a href="https://thecsrjournal.in/csr-news-top-csr-projects-truck-drivers-india" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">spending money on driver health</a> is not just the right thing to do, but also a smart business move that pays off in the following ways:</p>



<p><strong>Strong Business Case</strong></p>



<p>Healthier drivers mean fewer sick days, reduced attrition, and better performance. This has a positive impact on delivery timelines, fuel efficiency, and workforce morale—translating care into cost savings.</p>



<p><strong>Enhanced Public Image</strong></p>



<p>In an era of conscious consumerism, showing genuine concern for frontline workers improves public trust. Customers notice when brands treat their workforce.</p>



<p><strong>Competitive Advantage</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Companies that offer full health benefits, such as preventive physiotherapy, can position themselves as progressive employers who really care about the health of their drivers. This is especially helpful for attracting and retaining skilled drivers&nbsp;and competing with companies that simply offer minimal pay.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-key-corporate-initiatives-include"><strong>Key corporate initiatives include:</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Mobile health units</strong> that offer physiotherapy services at truck stops and highway rest areas. </li>



<li><strong>Technology-based solutions</strong> include driver health apps, wearable devices for posture monitoring, and telemedicine consultations. They can add basic wellness solutions, such applications with stretching exercises, reminder alerts, or films, to logistical platforms that are already in use.</li>



<li><strong>Working with physiotherapy clinics, NGOs and hospitals</strong> to establish full networks of preventative care.</li>



<li><strong>Adding to current wellness initiatives</strong> to give contracted drivers and fleet partners the same health benefits as employees. </li>



<li><strong>The education part</strong> can include things like being aware of how your body works, how to securely move freight and equipment, how to sit up straight, when to take breaks and change positions, how to see early signs, how to sleep properly, and how to eat well. </li>



<li><strong>Regular screenings</strong> can happen every three or six months, just like how corporations examine their employees&#8217; health on a regular basis.</li>
</ul>



<p>While road safety and fatigue have attracted some public attention, one critical area remains alarmingly overlooked: preventive physiotherapy<strong>.</strong> Truck drivers in India are the backbone of our economy, yet their health is not a priority. Corporate India has to start taking genuine, proactive action. Investing in physiotherapy isn&#8217;t charity; it&#8217;s sensible, long-lasting, and fair. A driver who is healthier now will make the supply chain safer and stronger tomorrow. Without their diligent efforts, the sophisticated web of supply chains that powers India&#8217;s economy would come to a halt. With the right design, care can meet them where they are—on the move.</p>

<p>One remarkably simple practice stands out for its effectiveness, affordability, and accessibility in the landscape of public health interventions:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<h3 id="h-handwashing-with-soap" class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Handwashing with soap.</strong></h3>
</blockquote>

<p>From preventing diarrhoea and respiratory infections to reducing neonatal deaths, the humble act of hand hygiene is backed by decades of compelling evidence. Yet, despite widespread awareness and proven efficacy, regular handwashing remains elusive for many communities especially in low-resource settings.</p>

<p>This persistent gap between knowledge and practice raises a critical question: How do we turn awareness into sustained behaviour change? The answer lies in data, design, and deeply human-centred approaches.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-science-is-settled-handwashing-saves-lives" class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The science is settled: Handwashing saves lives</strong></h2>

<p>Numerous studies confirm the many <a class="wpil_keyword_link" title="Health" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2487" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> benefits of handwashing. A systematic review published in <em>The Lancet</em> found that handwashing with soap reduces the incidence of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) by <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)00021-1/fulltext" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">17% in low- and middle-income countries</a>. The same study reported reductions of 22% in lower respiratory infections and 26% in upper respiratory infections.</p>

<p>Its impact on diarrhoeal diseases is even more dramatic—reducing incidence by 30% to 48%, depending on context. Gastrointestinal infections drop by up to 31% when regular handwashing is practiced. Maternal and neonatal health outcomes also improve significantly: exposure to maternal and birth attendant handwashing has been associated with a significant reduction in neonatal mortality.</p>

<p>These numbers illustrate that handwashing interrupts the chain of infection. Most bacteria and viruses (coronaviruses included) have lipid membranes that soap molecules break down, effectively destroying the pathogens. Combined with scrubbing, this physically removes dirt, microbes, and contaminants from the hands.</p>

<p>And yet, this scientifically sound, low-cost intervention is underused.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-access-and-awareness-gap" class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The access and awareness gap</strong></h2>

<p>In 2023, only 71% of the world’s population had access to basic handwashing facilities at home. In the least developed countries, the figure was only 37%, according to the World Health Organization. But access isn’t the only issue. Even in households with soap and water, handwashing is often skipped due to habit, lack of prioritisation, or low perceived risk.</p>

<p>Children, who can benefit the most, are not always exposed to consistent hygiene messaging. A 2016 cross-sectional study in Mumbai found that while over half of surveyed children experienced illness in a single month with most missing school, only 18% washed their hands after using the toilet. Fewer than 1% followed all recommended handwashing steps.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic served as a global wake-up call to the importance of hand hygiene. For a time, handwashing rose to the top of public health priorities, supported by widespread campaigns and institutional mandates. However, as the immediate threat of the virus subsided, so too did the urgency around this basic preventive measure. The challenge now lies in translating that temporary shift into permanent behaviour change especially in communities where structural barriers and inconsistent messaging persist.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-economic-case-for-handwashing-behaviour-change" class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The economic case for handwashing behaviour change</strong></h2>

<p>Health benefits aside, handwashing behaviour change brings measurable economic gains. In schools, hygiene programmes can reduce absenteeism by up to 20%, per WHO estimates. Better attendance improves academic performance and life outcomes.</p>

<p>At the national level, a 2017 study estimated that implementing a behaviour change handwashing campaign across India could yield USD 5.64 billion in net benefits—equivalent to 0.3% of GDP—representing a 92-fold return on investment. The mechanisms are clear: fewer sick days, reduced healthcare costs, and greater workforce productivity.</p>

<p>When viewed through this lens, handwashing is not just a health intervention—it’s an economic accelerator.</p>

<h2 id="h-why-people-don-t-wash-their-hands-even-when-they-can" class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why people don’t wash their hands (Even when they can)</strong></h2>

<p>Despite the data, habits are hard to change. Several behavioural and systemic barriers stand in the way:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Resource constraints:</strong> In many rural and underserved areas, clean water is scarce. Soap may be considered a luxury item.</li>

<li><strong>Invisible risk:</strong> Because germs are not visible, the consequences of poor hygiene seem distant or insignificant until illness strikes.</li>

<li><strong>Competing priorities:</strong> In daily life, especially in under-resourced households, hand hygiene competes with urgent needs like earning a living or caring for family.</li>

<li><strong>Weak social norms:</strong> If children don’t see adults consistently washing hands, they’re unlikely to internalise the habit.</li>

<li><strong>Psychological distance:</strong> Many families view diarrhoea or respiratory illness as routine, not preventable. It takes a crisis—like COVID-19—to disrupt that belief.</li>
</ul>

<p>What’s needed are behaviour change interventions that are not only evidence-based but emotionally resonant, socially embedded, and habit-forming.</p>

<h3 id="h-behaviour-change-that-works-the-school-of-five" class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Behaviour change that works: The ‘School of Five’</strong></h3>

<p>Among the standout examples is the Lifebuoy ‘School of Five’ campaign by Unilever. Launched in India, the campaign used storytelling and child-centred design to instil handwashing habits at five key moments each day—before meals, after using the toilet, and during bathing.</p>

<p>The programme’s innovation lay in its delivery: five superhero characters guided children through a 21-day routine designed to form a habit. It used comics, songs, games, and public events. Teachers, parents, and community leaders reinforced the message, creating an ecosystem of behavioural nudges.</p>

<p>The campaign reached<strong> over</strong> <strong>458 million people globally.</strong> In Madhya Pradesh’s Thesgora village, the incidence of diarrhoea dropped from 36% to 5%, and handwashing before meals rose by 26%. Nationally, it’s been associated with a 20% reduction in under-five mortality.</p>

<p>This success illustrates a key principle of behaviour change: frequency builds habit, and emotional engagement sustains it.</p>

<h2 id="h-local-innovations-smile-s-work" class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Local innovations: Smile’s work</strong></h2>

<p>In India, Smile Foundation has been integrating hand hygiene promotion into community health initiatives, particularly targeting children, young mothers, and vulnerable populations.</p>

<p>As part of our <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/donation/healthcare" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Health Cannot Wait</a></strong> campaign, over 150,000 hygiene kits containing soap, hand sanitisers, and masks were distributed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through tele-counselling and WhatsApp groups, frontline health workers educated thousands on handwashing practices, reinforcing key techniques.</p>

<p>In October 2023, a workshop at Nilgiri Hills Public School in Noida reached over 700 students. Children were taught about oral hygiene, personal cleanliness, and hand hygiene, empowering them to become agents of change within their communities.</p>

<p>Smile Foundation’s mobile health units, operating under the Smile on Wheels programme, deliver routine hygiene <a class="wpil_keyword_link" title="Education" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2488" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> to underserved communities. Health workers regularly demonstrate correct handwashing steps and engage mothers in protecting their children through hygiene.</p>

<p>In total, Smile Foundation supported over 1.2 million people across 16 Indian states in 2024 through its hygiene and health initiatives.</p>

<h2 id="h-making-the-invisible-visible" class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Making the invisible visible</strong></h2>

<p>What all these campaigns have in common is a shift from transactional health messaging to transformational community engagement. They make the invisible—germs, risks, behaviours—visible and emotionally relevant.</p>

<p>To sustain behaviour change at scale, we need:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Reliable access:</strong> Ensure soap and water are readily available at homes, schools, and public places.</li>

<li><strong>Early education:</strong> Introduce hand hygiene habits in early childhood through school curricula and storytelling.</li>

<li><strong>Behavioural insights:</strong> Use behavioural science to shape interventions—habits form with repetition, rewards, and social proof.</li>

<li><strong>Cross-sector partnerships:</strong> Collaborate across health, education, WASH, and private sectors to create consistent messaging and infrastructure.</li>

<li><strong>Local leadership:</strong> Equip frontline health workers, teachers, and parents to be role models and messengers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Handwashing with soap remains one of the most powerful, scalable, and affordable tools in global health. But its true impact depends not just on the presence of water and soap but on sustained human behaviour.</p>

<p>We’ve seen what works. Pair science with storytelling. Combine infrastructure with empathy. Make the healthy choice the easy choice. In doing so, we build healthier, more resilient communities.</p>

<p>As policymakers and practitioners look toward solving complex health challenges, the story of handwashing behaviour change offers a clear lesson: <strong>never underestimate the power of small acts, repeated often, by many</strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the riverine zones of Assam, where floods reshape the landscape quite regularly and roads are often swallowed by rising waters, healthcare access remains a significant challenge. This region, marked by isolation and infrastructure constraints, is home to thousands who live on the fringes of the healthcare system. But a new <a href="https://business-northeast.com/msd-mobile-boat-clinics-healthcare-assam" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">initiative</a>, a partnership between MSD Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd and the Smile Foundation, is making waves in these remote areas, quite literally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through this CSR-backed initiative, MSD has introduced two Mobile Medical Units (MMUs) and a boat clinic that now serve 12 districts and 12 island clusters across Assam through our <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Health Cannot Wait</a></strong> initiative. Among the districts served are Darrang, Barpeta, and South Salmara—areas with difficult terrain, unpredictable floods, and a population often cut off from the nearest hospital. The aim is to deliver healthcare to over 25,000 people in the first phase, directly bringing services to the doorsteps of those who need it the most.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Navigating key challenges</strong></h2>



<p>Assam&#8217;s riverine areas, vulnerable to the seasonal floods of the Brahmaputra, face some of the most significant challenges in healthcare delivery in the country. Traditional healthcare infrastructure, including primary health centres, is often underfunded or rendered inaccessible during the monsoon season in many areas that are situated near a river. Roads are submerged by floodwaters, and many river islands remain isolated for extended periods, further complicating access to essential medical services. Thus there is no doubt that delivering healthcare in riverine zones is fraught with myriad challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with geographical isolation, a shortage of trained healthcare professionals exacerbates the issue, as doctors are reluctant to work in remote regions with poor living conditions and limited amenities. Communication barriers, including low literacy, multiple dialects, and limited mobile coverage, hinder health <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2468" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> and awareness efforts. Additionally, these areas also face a high disease burden, with frequent outbreaks of waterborne diseases, malaria, dengue, and poor maternal and child health due to inadequate sanitation and nutrition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, in such regions, the boat clinic model, as discussed above, is a game-changer. These clinics are not stationary—they are mobile and capable of reaching communities that are otherwise disconnected from the formal healthcare system. Equipped with diagnostic tools, medications, and staffed by a doctor, nurse, counsellor, and driver, the boat clinic provides essential services including consultations, immunisations, maternal care, and basic treatments. What makes this model particularly effective is its community-based staffing, ensuring the staff not only speaks the local dialects but also understands the region’s cultural nuances and health concerns. This personalised approach fosters trust and enhances outreach. Additionally, the mobile medical units further complement the boat clinics by reaching areas where the river cannot, ensuring that every remote village has access to medical services.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Corporate responsibility meets public health</strong></h2>



<p>MSD Pharmaceuticals partnership with Smile Foundation marks a shift in how <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" title="Corporate Partnerships" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="368" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">corporate social responsibility</a> can be aligned with long-term, sustainable healthcare solutions in India’s most underdeveloped regions. Rather than simply donating funds or products, this collaboration aims to build rural health infrastructure—a much-needed resource in India’s under-served districts. The project aligns with NITI Aayog’s Aspirational Districts Programme, which focuses on uplifting areas that lag behind in health, education, and basic infrastructure. By positioning healthcare as essential infrastructure and supporting it through CSR initiatives, this case demonstrates how businesses can significantly contribute to public health, particularly in geographically and politically complex regions like Northeast India, where traditional healthcare systems face significant challenges.</p>



<p>This approach further underscores the potential for public-private partnerships to reshape healthcare delivery in rural India. Instead of relying solely on conventional healthcare infrastructure, businesses are leveraging mobile solutions and localised staffing to provide immediate, impactful care to those who need it the most. By targeting regions with limited or no <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/csr-initiatives-and-better-healthcare-access-in-rural-areas/" title="CSR Initiatives and Better Healthcare Access in Rural Areas" data-wpil-monitor-id="2491" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">access to healthcare</a>, these initiatives go beyond just fulfilling CSR obligations; they actively contribute to advancing health equity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Myriad ways out</strong></h2>



<p>Just like Assam, the remote riverine zones of the Mahanadi River Delta in Odisha face significant challenges in accessing healthcare, as communities are scattered across islands and difficult-to-reach shores. In response to these challenges, the eSanjeevani project—a National Telemedicine Service—has been implemented to bridge this healthcare gap. Telemedicine has emerged as a promising solution to address the healthcare needs of these remote, rural regions, where access to specialist consultations and medical services is often limited.</p>



<p>Leveraging satellite and internet connectivity, telemedicine brings specialist medical advice and diagnosis to even the most isolated villages. Through this technology, patients can connect remotely with doctors in urban hospitals, facilitating consultations, follow-up treatments, and remote monitoring of chronic conditions—all without the need for long and difficult travel. In practice, local health workers use video consultations to connect patients to specialists in urban centers, providing diagnoses, medical advice, and prescriptions remotely. For many residents, this service has become a lifeline.</p>



<p>In addition to telemedicine, community health workers, particularly Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs), can also play a crucial role in these riverine zones. ASHAs, female grassroot community workers, are often the only link between underserved populations and formal healthcare systems. They build a sense of trust within the communities, making them uniquely positioned to promote health and well-being. </p>



<p>Additionally, they are also trained to carry out a wide range of essential tasks—such as conducting health surveys, promoting hygiene, and guiding maternal care. They ensure that critical healthcare information and services reach the most remote areas, further extending access to the marginalised and improving public health outcomes at the grassroots level.</p>

<p>India’s healthcare sector is evolving rapidly, driven by strategic investments, increasing biopharma funding, and dynamic cross-industry collaborations. In 2024 alone, the industry witnessed a 24% rise in funding, with 2025 set to surpass expectations. The country remains a <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/04/india-healthcare-ai-innovation/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">global leader in generics and biosimilars</a>, while AI-powered partnerships between technology and pharmaceutical companies are transforming diagnostics and data-led care. Yet, a vital question remains: <strong>are these innovations truly reaching India’s rural healthcare system? </strong>Public-private partnerships and mobile medical units could hold the key to delivering equitable, technology-enabled care to underserved communities.</p>

<p>This testimonial underscores the multifaceted challenges of India’s rural healthcare system. Building an inclusive rural healthcare ecosystem in India is vital to ensuring equitable access to medical services for all. Initiatives that deliver compassionate, doorstep healthcare solutions like<strong> Mobile Medical Units </strong>can play a crucial role in<a href="https://journals.lww.com/ijcm/fulltext/2018/43030/Challenges_to_Healthcare_in_India___The_Five_A_s.1.aspx" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> bridging systemic gaps</a>—particularly for underserved communities.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Infrastructure Deficit Hindering Equitable Access to Care<br></strong> Despite national advancements, rural healthcare infrastructure remains significantly underdeveloped, with inadequate facilities, outdated equipment, and poor connectivity. This disparity perpetuates unequal access to quality medical services and delays timely intervention in vulnerable communities.<br></li>



<li><strong>Severe Shortage of Trained Medical Professionals in Rural Regions</strong><strong><br></strong> A persistent dearth of qualified doctors, nurses, and specialists in rural areas severely undermines the continuity and quality of care. Overburdened and under-supported, frontline health workers struggle to meet the needs of dispersed populations, affecting outcomes at scale.<br></li>



<li><strong>Healthcare Access Disrupted by <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" title="Livelihood" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="610" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Livelihood</a> Dependency and Geographic Barriers</strong><strong><br></strong> Many rural residents face a distressing trade-off: travel long distances for medical attention or lose crucial daily wages. The absence of proximal, functional healthcare centres forces patients to defer treatment, often until emergencies arise.<br></li>



<li><strong>The Economic Toll of Illness: Families Forced into Debt for Basic Treatment</strong><strong><br></strong> With limited affordable care options locally, families are frequently compelled to sell land or incur high-interest loans to access treatment in urban centres. This financial burden deepens rural poverty, making healthcare a source of long-term socioeconomic distress.</li>
</ul>



<p>However, to sustain and scale such impact, the persistent challenges of infrastructure, accessibility, and affordability must be addressed collectively. <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" title="Corporate Partnerships" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="367" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Corporate Social Responsibility</a> (CSR) has a pivotal role to play in this transformation<em>.</em> By aligning business responsibility with community health needs, corporations can help strengthen rural healthcare delivery, making quality care not a privilege, but a fundamental right for every citizen, regardless of geography or income.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Taking Healthcare to Villages, Backed by CSR</strong><br></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CYY09333-1-1024x683.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-11299" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CYY09333-1-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CYY09333-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CYY09333-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CYY09333-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CYY09333-1-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CYY09333-1-1200x800.jpeg 1200w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CYY09333-1-1980x1320.jpeg 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>India’s healthcare landscape has been significantly transformed by key government health initiatives such as &#8211;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Ayushman Bharat and the National Health Mission (comprising NRHM and NUHM) are key public health initiatives in India.</li>



<li>A strong focus is placed on Reproductive-Maternal-Neonatal-Child-Adolescent Health (RMNCH+A) to address critical life stages.</li>



<li>These programmes have significantly expanded healthcare access in underserved and remote regions.</li>



<li>They address both communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCDs).</li>



<li>The approach emphasises not only treatment but also preventive care and the promotion of community wellbeing.</li>
</ul>



<p>Despite this progress, accessibility to healthcare services remains uneven across rural geographies. While government-backed initiatives lay the foundational framework, there is an urgent need for delivery mechanisms that can bridge the last-mile gap. This is where <em>Mobile Medical Units (MMUs), supported through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) investments, have become a critical enabler.</em></p>



<p><strong>CSR-backed MMUs</strong> serve as a lifeline for communities often left out of mainstream healthcare delivery. They bring:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>&nbsp;Medical diagnostics and treatment directly to village doorsteps.</li>



<li>&nbsp;Act as catalysts for promoting healthy habits and preventive awareness—amplifying the impact of government programmes on the ground.</li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;In essence, they operationalise<strong> the “3 As” of effective healthcare delivery</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Affordability</strong></li>



<li><strong>Accessibility</strong></li>



<li><strong>Awareness</strong></li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Strategic Benefit</strong></td><td><strong>Implementation</strong></td><td><strong>Impact</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Extending Lifespan in Underserved Areas<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Reducing Treatment Complications through Early Access<br><br><br><br>Lowering Financial Burden for Rural Families<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Saving Lives through Timely Screening and Diagnosis</td><td>Mobile Medical Units enable early detection and management of diseases, especially Non communicable diseases, directly within remote communities—improving long-term health outcomes and life expectancy.<br><br>Immediate access to basic healthcare reduces delays, preventing escalation of treatable conditions.

<p>The integration of Mobile Medical Units into India’s broader healthcare strategy represents a convergence of public intent and private capability. Corporates, through targeted CSR investments, have the opportunity to supplement public health infrastructure by extending their reach, scaling impact, and ensuring that the promise of equitable healthcare is not limited by geography. Moreover, such initiatives humanise corporate action, translating boardroom decisions into real, tangible outcomes in the lives of vulnerable populations.</p>
