										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It used to be simple, didn’t it?</p>



<p>You were told—sweetly, sharply, or with the ferocity of a middle-class parent who’d seen too much disappointment—that your destiny lay in becoming a doctor, an engineer, or if your handwriting was particularly elegant, a government officer. Careers weren’t choices; they were inherited burdens, passed down like wedding silver.</p>



<p>We didn’t so much choose our professions as fall into them, like open manholes.</p>



<p>But the world, as it’s inclined to do, shifted. It got louder, faster, and oddly more opinionated. Suddenly people were making a living designing cartoon avatars, managing social media meltdowns, or filming monkeys for documentaries watched by twelve million people in Denmark. Careers now came with adjectives: hybrid, remote, agile, gig-based, AI-driven.</p>



<p>And into this whirling, chattering void of possibility, we push our young people with a pat on the back and a panicked “figure it out.”</p>



<p>What we forget, what we always forget, is that they’re overwhelmed. They aren’t choosing between law and medicine anymore. They’re choosing between 4,000 courses, 5,000 certifications, and a gnawing sense that one wrong step might ruin their entire twenties.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-overwhelm-is-real"><strong>The overwhelm is real</strong></h2>



<p>A study by the IC3 Institute and FLAME University tells us what our gut already knows: nearly <a href="https://www.flame.edu.in/in-the-media/over-80-students-benefit-from-career-counselling-40-lack-access-report" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">a third of students</a> in India have either no access to counselling or no structured support at all. And for those who do? Well, it’s often a five-minute conversation wedged between exam prep and a lecture on the dangers of TikTok.</p>



<p>The truth is, no matter how much the world has changed, we haven’t quite caught up in how we prepare young people for it. We hand them <a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-report-2023/digest/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">infinite options</a> and then judge them for feeling paralysed. It’s a bit like tossing someone into a library and demanding they pick the one book they’ll read forever.</p>



<p>What they need isn’t more options. It’s guidance. Context. A mirror and a map.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-career-counselling-the-compass-in-the-chaos"><strong>Career counselling: The compass in the chaos</strong></h2>



<p>What real, thoughtful career counselling does is deceptively simple. It says:<br><em>&#8220;Let’s stop. Let’s talk about you. Not your cousin. Not your neighbour’s son. You.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>It begins with <strong>self-awareness</strong>, that slippery thing most of us don’t develop until we’ve already made our worst mistakes. Through assessments and conversations—not interrogations—counsellors help students uncover their interests, strengths, blind spots, and ambitions they’re half-afraid to say aloud.</p>



<p>Then comes the <strong>exploration phase</strong>—that glorious moment where a teenager finds out “marine biologist” is a real job, or that psychology doesn’t mean becoming a psychiatrist, or that data science might be the new architecture.</p>



<p>After the spark, comes the scaffolding. Counsellors work with students to <strong>set goals</strong>, plot academic journeys, shortlist courses and colleges, decode scholarships, and help them understand what’s actually required to walk the path they’ve just chosen. This is not YouTube advice. This is curated, focused, real-life planning.</p>



<p>And it doesn’t stop at planning. Good counselling provides <strong>ongoing support</strong>—through application deadlines, form-filling panic, interviews, confusion, heartbreak, and do-I-even-want-this-anymore moments. In other words, they stay.</p>



<p>They do what family often can’t and Google never will: <strong>they listen, they guide, and they stay.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-career-counselling-matters-more-than-ever"><strong>Why career counselling matters more than ever</strong></h2>



<p>Today, choosing a career is not just about picking a subject in school or college. It’s about understanding:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>What am I good at?</li>



<li>What skills are needed in the real world?</li>



<li>Will this job still exist in ten years?</li>



<li>What <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2511" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> or experience will get me there?</li>
</ul>



<p>Career counselling provides a safe space to explore these questions. In a world shaped by AI, automation, the gig economy, and fast-evolving job roles, professional guidance can mean the difference between an aligned, fulfilling path, and years spent drifting from one career to another.</p>



<p>Beyond skill alignment, counsellors help cut through the noise created by:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Peer pressure</strong></li>



<li><strong>Societal expectations</strong></li>



<li><strong>Parental fears</strong></li>



<li><strong>Misinformation online</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>When students are provided a structured framework for reflection, they move from uncertainty to action.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smile-foundation-making-career-counselling-accessible-to-all"><strong>Smile Foundation: Making career counselling accessible to all</strong></h2>



<p>While urban schools may have the privilege of trained counsellors and international career exposure, the same cannot be said for underserved communities. This is where Smile Foundation’s career counselling initiatives steps up.</p>



<p>Through its flagship <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Smile Twin e-Learning Programme (STeP)</a></strong>, Smile Foundation provides career-focused interventions to youth from low-income communities across India. The programme offers:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Career counselling sessions in government and low-resource schools.</li>



<li>One-on-one mentorship for young people preparing for employment.</li>



<li>Life skills, digital literacy, and workplace readiness training.</li>



<li>Strategic partnerships with private sector companies to deliver industry-aligned guidance.</li>
</ul>



<p>Smile Foundation also incorporates career awareness in its broader education initiatives like <strong>Shiksha Na Ruke, She Can Fly,</strong> and <strong>Tayyari Kal Ki</strong>, ensuring that children and youth—especially girls—are not only educated, but empowered to dream and plan for sustainable careers.</p>



<p>In classrooms where the idea of “career” once felt distant, career counselling has brought direction, dignity, and hope.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-career-counselling-helps-a-4-step-journey"><strong>How career counselling helps – A 4-step journey</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-self-awareness"><strong>1. Self-awareness</strong></h3>



<p>The first step to a meaningful career is understanding oneself.<br>Career counselling often begins with psychometric tools, aptitude assessments, and reflective exercises to help students identify:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Strengths and weaknesses</li>



<li>Interests and motivations</li>



<li>Work style preferences</li>
</ul>



<p>Self-awareness lays the foundation for confident choices and helps students resist the pressure to “follow the herd.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-exploration-of-options"><strong>2. Exploration of options</strong></h3>



<p>With thousands of career paths available, a professional counsellor becomes a critical bridge between student potential and real-world opportunities.</p>



<p>Whether it’s choosing between journalism and design, or exploring lesser-known fields like environmental law or UX writing, counsellors help students:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Understand course and college options</li>



<li>Know what skills are required</li>



<li>Learn about industry trends and job scopes</li>
</ul>



<p>For youth in Smile Foundation programmes, this phase often becomes the first time they hear that their passion can become a profession.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-goal-setting-and-preparation"><strong>3. Goal-setting and preparation</strong></h3>



<p>After clarity comes action.</p>



<p>Career counselling includes setting short- and long-term goals and creating personalised academic or vocational roadmaps, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>College applications and entrance exams</li>



<li>Financial planning and scholarship identification</li>



<li>Skill-building courses, internships, or volunteering</li>
</ul>



<p>Smile Foundation also guides students through training modules, communication skills, and industry exposure visits, enabling them to step into the workforce with confidence.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-implementation-and-ongoing-support"><strong>4. Implementation and ongoing support</strong></h3>



<p>The final stage is bringing it all together—executing the plan, and staying responsive to change.</p>



<p>Counsellors support students through:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Admissions</li>



<li>Form filling and documentation</li>



<li>Interview preparation</li>



<li>Dealing with rejection or reevaluation</li>
</ul>



<p>What makes this guidance unique is that it doesn’t end with a test score or a college list—it continues as a relationship.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-levelling-the-playing-field"><strong>Levelling the playing field</strong></h2>



<p>While the need for career guidance is universal, access is not. Urban private schools often have entire teams dedicated to college and career counselling, while students in government or low-income schools rely on luck, instinct, or hearsay.</p>



<p>By integrating career counselling into its education and skilling programmes, Smile helps break generational cycles of poverty by turning learning into livelihood.</p>



<p>Their impact is not only in the number of students trained, but in:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The girls who choose engineering over early marriage</li>



<li>The boys who discover design instead of defaulting to manual labour</li>



<li>The first-generation learners who now mentor others</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-the-future-depends-on-career-counselling"><strong>Why the future depends on career counselling</strong></h2>



<p>The future of work is dynamic. Roles that didn’t exist five years ago, like AI prompt engineers or sustainability analysts, are now in high demand. At the same time, core skills like communication, creativity, and collaboration are becoming more valuable than ever.</p>



<p>Career counselling empowers young people to make decisions not based on survival, but on self-knowledge and aspiration.</p>



<p>By integrating career guidance into education systems, formal or non-formal, we give students the tools to navigate complexity with confidence. And by investing in organisations like <strong>Smile Foundation</strong>, we ensure that this clarity isn’t just for the privileged, but for every child with a dream.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-conclusion-guidance-is-the-new-equity"><strong>In conclusion: Guidance is the new equity</strong></h2>



<p>Career confusion is normal, but staying confused shouldn’t be.<br>When we invest in career counselling, we invest in clarity, confidence, and choice. We help build futures that are not just employable but <strong>empowered</strong>.</p>



<p>And for thousands of young people in India, Smile Foundation is making that possible—<strong>one counselling session at a time</strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>India is home to the world’s largest youth population, a demographic asset that could drive long-term economic growth—if supported effectively. However, the paradox of a young, educated population facing mounting unemployment continues to challenge policymakers, educators, and development practitioners. As the job market becomes increasingly competitive and sector-specific, structured placement support has emerged as a critical link between education and employability, particularly for youth from underserved backgrounds.</p>



<p>Placement-oriented interventions, especially those integrated with skills training and mentorship, offer young people a pathway not just to jobs—but to confidence, agency, and long-term upward mobility.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-transition-from-classroom-to-career"><strong>The transition from classroom to career</strong></h2>



<p>Placement support serves as a crucial bridge between academic learning and real-world employment. It introduces students to sector-specific career paths, provides access to reputable employers, and fosters soft skills essential for workplace readiness. Beyond this technical value, placements significantly impact young people&#8217;s self-esteem, financial independence, and social mobility.</p>



<p>Importantly, structured placement programs promote equity and access in higher <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2523" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a>. When colleges and training centres proactively engage with employers, offer preparatory sessions, and ensure accessibility in interviews, they create pathways for students across all backgrounds—including first-generation learners, women, and persons with disabilities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-navigating-a-youth-employment-crisis"><strong>Navigating a youth employment crisis</strong></h2>



<p>Youth unemployment is not a cyclical concern in India; it is a structural issue. Despite increasing enrollment in higher education, the transition to stable employment remains fraught. According to the 2024 Department of Economic Affairs evaluation, only 51% of final-year students in India were deemed employable.</p>



<p>This is compounded by worrying placement trends. According to media reports, placement rates at many higher education institutions were expected to fall between 30% and 70% in 2024. Global hiring slowdowns, layoffs in tech and services, and a 15–30% drop in campus recruiters, particularly in Tier 2 institutions, have further strained the transition from college to work.</p>



<p>India’s large middle class increasingly views quality placements as the single most important factor in college selection, more so than faculty or academic rankings. In this climate, the role of placement support is not optional—it is foundational to the promise of education.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-effective-placement-support-looks-like"><strong>What effective placement support looks like</strong></h2>



<p>To address this challenge, educational institutions and development partners have introduced a variety of interventions to build employability:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Vocational training and certification</strong> aligned with labour market demands</li>



<li><strong>Industry partnerships</strong> to enable real-time skill alignment</li>



<li><strong>Internships, apprenticeships, and job shadowing</strong> to foster experiential learning</li>



<li><strong>Soft skill development</strong> in communication, problem-solving, and workplace ethics</li>



<li><strong>Mentorship and coaching</strong> to build confidence and guide job-seeking behaviour</li>
</ul>



<p>A growing number of initiatives now combine these components into comprehensive employment programs. By closing the skills gap, building professional networks, and providing job placement services, such efforts address both the supply- and demand-side constraints of youth unemployment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-evidence-of-impact-confidence-and-career-trajectories"><strong>Evidence of impact: Confidence and career trajectories</strong></h2>



<p>Several studies have shown the positive correlation between structured placements and long-term employment outcomes. One analysis found that students who completed formal work placements were 50% more likely to secure a job with higher starting salaries than those who did not. A 2023 study of engineering undergraduates reported a 5.7% increase in academic performance among students who participated in placements, indicating improved motivation and better integration of classroom and workplace learning.</p>



<p>Placements also help in developing resilience and adaptability, both critical for navigating the complexities of the modern workforce.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smile-foundation-s-skill-and-placement-ecosystem"><strong>Smile Foundation’s skill and placement ecosystem</strong></h2>



<p>Through its flagship <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow"><strong>Smile Twin e-Learning Programme (STeP)</strong></a>, Smile foundation offers comprehensive training in employability, digital literacy, healthcare, retail, banking, and communication skills across 74 centres in 8 states. With over 90,000 youth trained and more than 56,500 placed in jobs via partnerships with 400+ employers, STeP exemplifies how grassroots implementation can be scaled for systemic impact.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="765" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-7-1024x765.png" alt="" class="wp-image-13909" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-7-1024x765.png 1024w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-7-300x224.png 300w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-7-768x574.png 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-7-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-7-1200x896.png 1200w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-7.png 1580w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Smile’s <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/berger-paints-collaborates-with-smile-foundation-to-empower-young-painters-of-the-nation-through-the-itrain-on-wheels-program/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">iTrain on Wheels</a></strong>, developed with Berger Paints, extends this mission to the informal sector. The mobile training programme has upskilled over 90,000 painters across 24 states, equipping them with both technical and entrepreneurial skills to transition into stable livelihoods.</p>



<p>Another example is Smile Foundation’s partnership with Maxvision Social Welfare Society in Gurugram, where youth receive training in basic management, retail skills, spoken English, personality development, and computer literacy. These courses help shift employment trajectories from informal wage labour to formal, white-collar sectors—a transformation that enhances not just economic status, but also dignity and social inclusion.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="758" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-6-1024x758.png" alt="" class="wp-image-13908" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-6-1024x758.png 1024w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-6-300x222.png 300w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-6-768x568.png 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-6-1536x1136.png 1536w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-6-1200x888.png 1200w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/output-6.png 1595w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gender-inclusion-through-placement"><strong>Gender inclusion through placement</strong></h2>



<p>Smile Foundation’s <strong>Project Manzil</strong> exemplifies the gendered dimensions of placement support. Through this initiative, approximately 14,000 adolescent girls have received employability training, and an additional 5,000 have participated in on-the-job training placements. Manzil’s girl-centred approach—delivered both in and out of school—emphasises life skills, leadership, and stakeholder engagement to counteract socio-economic drivers of early marriage and school dropout.</p>



<p>Data consistently show that adolescent girls with vocational skills and job prospects are less likely to marry early and more likely to contribute to household decision-making. Empowerment through economic agency allows girls to negotiate timelines for marriage, pursue higher education, and envision alternative futures. Thus, placement support becomes a powerful strategy for advancing gender equality.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-policy-implications-and-the-way-forward"><strong>Policy implications and the way forward</strong></h2>



<p>Placement support is not merely a placement cell function—it is a policy imperative with macroeconomic relevance. India&#8217;s ability to leverage its demographic dividend will depend on how well it transitions millions of young people from classrooms into sustainable employment.</p>



<p>To maximise impact, the following strategies are recommended:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Integration with national skilling frameworks:</strong> Placement should be a core outcome of government initiatives like Skill India and PMKVY, not a peripheral service.</li>



<li><strong>Incentivising industry partnerships:</strong> Employers should be encouraged—through tax credits or <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" title="Corporate Partnerships" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2524" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">CSR</a> incentives—to hire from vocational and NGO-run training programmes.</li>



<li><strong>Mainstreaming soft skills training:</strong> Curriculum reform should integrate employability skills across disciplines, especially in general degrees.</li>



<li><strong>Support for non-urban youth:</strong> Rural and peri-urban youth face significant barriers to mobility and exposure. Mobile training models and tele-interview platforms can help bridge this divide.</li>



<li><strong>Sustained mentorship:</strong> Beyond placement, mentoring must continue to ensure retention, performance, and growth in first jobs.</li>



<li><strong>Monitoring and evaluation:</strong> Data on placement outcomes, wage levels, retention, and career growth should be used to iterate and improve program design.</li>
</ol>



<p>In a world where academic qualifications no longer guarantee employment, placement support is not a service—it is a social equaliser. By combining training, confidence-building, and strategic linkages to employers, placement-oriented programmes offer youth the opportunity to participate meaningfully in the economy.</p>



<p>As India faces both an employment crisis and a demographic opportunity, initiatives like those led by Smile Foundation show that with the right ecosystem—grounded in inclusion, industry engagement, and mentorship—youth potential can translate into prosperity.</p>



<p>Empowered with skills and guided into careers, today’s young job-seekers are not just looking for work—they are building futures.</p>

<p>“I come from Modgaon village in Maharashtra. For years, we lived with uncertainty never knowing if there would be work the next day, or food on the table. It was a constant struggle, and somewhere along the way, we forgot what it felt like to dream.</p>



<p>But a few of us women decided to change that. We came together and said let’s build something of our own. We didn’t have experience, only determination. With support from the Smile Foundation, we started a small rice mill.</p>



<p>We learnt everything from scratch how to run the machines, manage the accounts, and make it all work. The first time we earned from our own effort it brought tears to our eyes.</p>



<p>Today, we are not just earning money. We’ve found courage, dignity, and a voice we didn’t know we had. We walk with our heads held high, because we built this with our own hands, and together,”</p>



<p><strong>Sundari Nilesh</strong>, Rice mill entrepreneur</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In many quiet corners of rural India, a silent revolution is taking shape. It isn’t loud, and it rarely makes headlines. But it&#8217;s built on the resilience of women who are rewriting the rules of enterprise from bee farms to rice mills and cloth factories. These are women who were never short on potential, only opportunity.</p>



<p>For too long, the narrative of rural <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/no-future-without-women-entrepreneurs/" title="No Future without Women Entrepreneurs" data-wpil-monitor-id="1960" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">women entrepreneurs in India</a> has been confined to subsistence livelihoods— informal, seasonal, and low-income. But today, a new story is emerging, one of sustainable and scalable empowerment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-empowerment-begins-where-opportunity-is-extended"><strong>Empowerment begins where opportunity is extended</strong></h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“With Smile Foundation’s support, we turned beekeeping into a <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" title="Livelihood" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="345" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">livelihood</a>.

<p><strong>Chadramma</strong>, Beehive entrepreneur</p>
</blockquote>



<p>India has no shortage of skilled women. Yet, only 20% of businesses<em>*</em> in the country are led by women. And most of these are small, unregistered ventures with limited scope and scale. What holds them back isn’t ambition but systemic inaccessibility. A lack of training, <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/financial-literacy-among-rural-women/" title="Financial Literacy among Rural Women" data-wpil-monitor-id="1962" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">financial literacy</a>, mentorship, and formal support continues to shut women out of meaningful entrepreneurial opportunities.</p>



<p><strong>This is not just a gender issue— it’s an economic one.</strong></p>



<p>The untapped potential of women entrepreneurs represents a significant loss to local economies and national development goals.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-do-india-s-women-entrepreneurs-stand"><strong>Where do India’s women entrepreneurs stand?</strong></h2>



<p>According to a 2023 NITI Aayog report*, only 14% of Indian <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/celebrate-womens-day-2024-employee-engagement-activities/" title="Celebrate Women’s Day 2024: Employee Engagement Activities" data-wpil-monitor-id="1966" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">women are engaged in entrepreneurial activities</a> and even fewer in formal sectors. The barriers are steep:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Limited access to institutional credit<br></li>



<li>Inadequate digital infrastructure<br></li>



<li>Lack of gender-sensitive support systems<br></li>



<li>Social norms that restrict decision-making and ownership</li>
</ul>



<p>Despite multiple government schemes, the ground reality remains tough. Women know where they want to go— but the system often lacks the roadmaps to take them there.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-key-challenges-faced-by-women-entrepreneurs-in-india"><strong>Key challenges faced by women entrepreneurs in India</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/women-entrepreneurs-paving-the-way-for-an-equal-india/" title="Women Entrepreneurs Paving the Way for an Equal India" data-wpil-monitor-id="1965" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Women entrepreneurs in India</a> represent a significant yet underutilised segment of the economic landscape. Despite growing awareness and policy efforts, women still face <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/07/female-entrepreneurs-india-success-despite-funding-gap/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">systemic barriers</a> on their entrepreneurial journey. From financial exclusion to socio-cultural biases<em>,</em> the challenges are complex and deeply entrenched. Understanding these challenges is essential to designing effective interventions. Below are some of the key structural and societal barriers faced by women entrepreneurs across India.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Limited accessibility to financial schemes</strong><strong><br></strong>Despite the presence of government and institutional financial schemes for women entrepreneurs, access remains a major hurdle. Women often lack the resources or networks to navigate the system effectively.<br></li>



<li><strong>Collateral and credit barriers</strong><strong><br></strong>Banks and financial institutions frequently require collateral, which many women do not possess or have legal ownership over. Creditworthiness is often questioned, reinforcing financial exclusion.<br></li>



<li><strong>Complex and bureaucratic processes</strong><strong><br></strong>Application procedures for loans and schemes are often lengthy, technical, and not user-friendly. Documentation and verification requirements often create extra barriers for first-time women entrepreneurs.<br></li>



<li><strong>Lack of structured mentorship</strong><strong><br></strong>Women entrepreneurs frequently operate without access to industry mentors, peer networks, or professional guidance. The absence of mentorship limits their ability to scale, innovate, or navigate regulatory frameworks.<br></li>



<li><strong>Inconsistent institutional and community support</strong><strong><br></strong>Support systems are fragmented across institutions, and the continuity of assistance is often uncertain and unreliable. Many schemes and interventions are short-term or lack proper follow-up mechanisms.<br></li>



<li><strong>Gender bias and societal stereotypes</strong><strong><br></strong>Gender bias manifests in financial institutions, corporate boardrooms, and local community interactions. Women often face scepticism or dismissal, undermining their business credibility and decision-making authority.<br></li>



<li><strong>Lack of real autonomy</strong><strong><br></strong>In many cases, women are listed as business owners on paper, while male family members retain operational control undermining genuine empowerment and limiting their entrepreneurial agency.<br></li>



<li><strong>Need for systemic redesign<br></strong>Addressing these challenges requires a shift from surface-level initiatives to structural reforms. Policies must be redesigned to ensure equitable <strong>access</strong>, <strong>inclusion</strong>, and <strong>sustained opportunity</strong> for women in entrepreneurship.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-strategic-interventions-for-women-entrepreneurs-in-india"><strong>Strategic interventions for women entrepreneurs in India</strong></h3>



<p>Behind every woman who dreams of starting her own business in India lies a complex web of challenges— but also a powerful potential waiting to be unlocked. While systemic barriers persist, thoughtfully designed and compassionately delivered strategic interventions can spark meaningful and lasting change.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-government-schemes-with-transformative-potential"><strong>1. Government schemes with transformative potential</strong></h4>



<p>Schemes like <strong>Stand-Up India</strong>, the <strong>Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP)</strong>, and the <strong>Mahila Samman Savings Certificate</strong> are policies that represent the promise of financial independence, dignity, and opportunity for millions of women.</p>



<p>But for many women, that promise remains just out of reach. The forms are lengthy, the steps confusing, the language bureaucratic. Picture a woman in a rural district, holding a printed government scheme in her hands with no one to help her navigate the maze.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-digital-and-financial-literacy-a-critical-lifeline"><strong>2. Digital and financial literacy: A critical lifeline</strong></h4>



<p>In today’s world, reading a bank statement, using a digital payment app, or filing a GST return online isn’t optional, it&#8217;s a necessity. But countless women entrepreneurs still lack access to these basic tools. Many are forced to rely on others—often men—for financial transactions, leaving them vulnerable and dependent.</p>



<p>Equipping women with <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/women-empowerment/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow"><strong>digital and financial literacy</strong></a> is about restoring that lost control. When a woman can manage her money, track her income, or apply for a loan from her phone, she doesn’t just grow a business— she reclaims control over her life.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-csr-ngo-partnerships-bridging-policy-and-practice"><strong>3. CSR–NGO partnerships: Bridging policy and practice</strong></h4>



<p>At the grassroots level, <strong>CSR–NGO partnerships</strong> play a unique and irreplaceable role. These organisations are often the only ones walking shoulder-to-shoulder with women, village to village, family to family helping them navigate loan applications, understand government schemes, and <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/development-organisations-and-building-sustainable-futures/" title="Development Organisations and Building Sustainable Futures" data-wpil-monitor-id="1963" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">build the self-belief that sustains</a> entrepreneurship.</p>



<p>NGOs for women in India such as Smile Foundation are not just facilitators. We work to bridge between ambition and achievement. A well-designed CSR programme, implemented through a trusted NGO, can spell the difference between a woman giving up or launching a successful enterprise.</p>



<p>These partnerships also bring flexibility, empathy, and adaptability— qualities large institutions often lack. They can plug gaps in last-mile delivery, offer mentoring, handhold during crises, and celebrate the everyday victories that may never make headlines but are life-changing on the ground.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-swabhiman-model-bridging-the-divide-for-women-entrepreneurs"><strong>Swabhiman model: Bridging the divide</strong> <strong>for women entrepreneurs</strong></h2>



<p>Smile Foundation’s <strong>Swabhiman Women Entrepreneurship Programme</strong> is rooted in the belief that true empowerment stems from the convergence of skills, opportunity, and sustained support. The initiative is designed to uplift underserved women, particularly those from marginalised communities, by enabling them to become economically self-reliant and socially confident.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The programme offers:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Integrated skill training tailored to rural contexts<br></li>



<li>Micro-enterprise incubation with ongoing mentorship<br></li>



<li>Linkages to formal finance and markets<br></li>



<li>Community-based mobilisation that builds trust and ownership<br></li>
</ul>



<p>The outcomes are measurable: rising incomes, improved <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="344" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> and education outcomes, and increased agency for women at the household and community level.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>In 2023-24 alone, the initiative supported more than 1, 90,000 women across the country.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-the-system-stops-social-investment-can-step-in"><strong>Where the system stops, social investment can step in</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Rural women entrepreneurs don’t seek charity, they seek partnership.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>They are determined, resourceful, and ready to lead change within their communities. What they need is access to opportunities, visibility for their efforts, and consistent support to sustain their journey. This is where <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/corporate-social-responsibility-csr-positive-community-impact/" title="Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): Positive Community Impact" data-wpil-monitor-id="1961" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">corporate social responsibility</a> can truly make a difference— not as a one-time intervention, but as a long-term investment in women-led transformation.</p>



<p>Smile Foundation’s <strong>Swabhiman </strong>initiative offers corporates a credible platform to align their CSR goals with inclusive, grassroots development. Through locally relevant vocational training combined with financial and digital literacy, Swabhiman equips women to build and manage sustainable enterprises. The programme cultivates leadership, strengthens life skills, and builds critical market linkages ensuring that economic empowerment goes hand in hand with social mobility.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">By partnering with Smile Foundation</a>, your organisation can move the needle on gender equity and inclusive growth supporting women to rise, families to thrive, and communities to flourish. Together, we can turn potential into progress.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>India stands at a critical juncture in its developmental journey, where the strength of its large and youthful population can be a powerful engine for economic growth—if properly harnessed. Despite being home to one of the world’s largest youth demographics, the country has overlooked the importance of structured vocational education and even digital skills. </p>



<p>The importance of vocational education in India was first formally emphasised in the <a href="https://www.education.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/upload_document/npe.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">National Policy on Education (NPE) 1986</a>, which recognised it as a crucial tool for reducing the growing mismatch between academic education and employment opportunities. This commitment was further reinforced by the Revised NPE in 1992, which reiterated the need for vocationalisation of education to enhance employability and economic relevance. </p>



<p>A significant leap in this direction came with the 11th Five-Year Plan (2007–2012), which laid the foundation for large-scale skill development initiatives, acknowledging that creating a skilled workforce was vital for accelerating inclusive growth. Thus, these sustained efforts over time have recognised that channelling the energy of India’s youth, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, holds importance. </p>



<p>The integration of digital skills into <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2462" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> and vocational training can play maybe the biggest role in empowering India’s youth. Government initiatives like Digital India and Skill India have laid the groundwork, but the pace of change requires greater collaboration between public institutions, private sector players, and civil society. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smile Foundation skilling the youth</strong></h2>



<p>A case in point is Smile Foundation’s Skilling programme, <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/donation/livelihood" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">STeP,</a> a collaborative network skilling the youth in high-growth sectors with strong potential for both revenue generation and employment. The programme is designed to support and complement the Skill India Mission, while also aligning with Sustainable Development Goals 4 (Quality Education) and 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth).</p>



<p>To date, the programme has successfully trained over 9,000 youth across eight states and facilitated sustainable employment for more than 5,500 individuals. It has established 74 skilling centres focused on sectors demonstrating significant growth potential. The programme adopts a practice-oriented approach, emphasising experiential learning and direct industry engagement. This is reflected in its robust network of over 400 employment partners, thus supporting the transition of trained youth into the workforce.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Imparting necessary digital skills through STeP</strong></h2>



<p>Across industries—from healthcare and finance to logistics and digital services—technology is reshaping the employment landscape, creating a surge in demand for specialised, job-ready skills. Recognising this shift, Smile Foundation’s STeP<strong> </strong>is thoughtfully designed to align with emerging sectors and their evolving skill requirements. </p>



<p>The programme covers a wide range of high-growth fields, such as <strong>Business Process Outsourcing (BPO)</strong>, which remains a major employment generator. It offers diverse roles in customer service, technical support, and back-office operations. Today’s BPO jobs require digital proficiency in Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tools, communication platforms, and basic automation, making them an accessible entry point into the digital workforce. Furthermore, with growing opportunities for remote work and upward mobility, BPO continues to be a future-proof career option.</p>



<p>Similarly, the <strong>banking and financial services industry</strong> is undergoing a rapid digital transformation. To thrive in this space, youth must gain skills in digital banking platforms, financial literacy, customer engagement, and regulatory compliance. As fintech solutions expand across both urban and rural India, the demand for digitally trained professionals is on the rise. </p>



<p>In the same vein, <strong>digital marketing </strong>has seen explosive demand as businesses expand their online presence. Skills such as Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Search Engine Marketing (SEM), social media strategy, email marketing, and content creation are vital for engaging audiences and driving growth—particularly for startups, freelancers, and entrepreneurs.</p>



<p>In parallel, <strong>e-logistics and supply chain management </strong>have become critical to India’s thriving e-commerce and manufacturing sectors. Proficiency in inventory control, digital tracking, warehouse management, and last-mile delivery operations is essential for those seeking long-term careers in this space. With businesses increasingly adopting technology-driven logistics models, this sector offers both growth and stability.</p>



<p>Lastly, the healthcare sector continues to offer stable and impactful opportunities through roles like <strong>General Duty Assistant (GDA) and patient care support.</strong> With training in basic healthcare practices, hygiene protocols, patient mobility, and digital <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1458" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> records, these professionals are indispensable in clinics, hospitals, and home-care settings. As India’s healthcare infrastructure grows, these roles provide both social value and professional advancement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Embracing novel technology</strong></h2>



<p>As India embraces digital transformation, emerging technologies are playing a key role in reshaping industries and creating new career opportunities. In today’s digital economy, <strong>Data Science and Big Data</strong> are essential skills. As organisations generate massive volumes of structured and unstructured data, the ability to analyse and extract meaningful insights has become indispensable for driving informed decision-making across sectors.</p>



<p>Another critical skill is <strong>Blockchain Technology</strong>. While commonly associated with cryptocurrency, blockchain&#8217;s decentralized systems and smart contracts are revolutionising industries by improving security, transparency, and efficiency. Professionals proficient in blockchain can find opportunities across sectors such as finance, logistics, and healthcare, where its transformative potential is rapidly expanding. <strong>Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) </strong>are significantly altering industries like gaming, education, healthcare, and e-commerce. As these immersive technologies continue to be adopted, the demand for skilled AR/VR professionals will rise, creating exciting career opportunities in both creative and technical roles.</p>



<p>Lastly, <strong>Digital Health and Telemedicine</strong> are transforming the healthcare landscape. The widespread adoption of telemedicine, electronic health records (EHR), and health informatics is making healthcare services more accessible and efficient. As the demand for digital healthcare solutions grows, there is an increasing need for professionals in health tech and patient support. This rapidly expanding sector provides India’s youth with the opportunity to contribute to the future of healthcare, helping to improve outcomes for patients across the country.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Upskilling and building transferable skills</strong></h2>



<p>In India’s vast informal economy, countless workers find themselves locked in a cycle of low-skill, low-wage labour with limited pathways to upward mobility. For many, the opportunity to improve their skills—and in turn, their livelihoods—remains out of reach. Recognising this challenge, Smile Foundation launched <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">iTrain on Wheels</a></strong>, a collaborative effort between Berger Paints India Ltd. and Smile Foundation, under Berger’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative. </p>



<p>The programme attempts to bridge the skill gap among local painters by offering specialised, hands-on training in contemporary painting techniques, safety standards, and customer service. Painters are also equipped with basic entrepreneurial skills, empowering them to manage their work independently, engage with clients more effectively, and even expand their own teams. </p>



<p>Since its inception, over 1,18,000 painters across 25 states have been upskilled. In the process, the programme has not only improved technical capabilities but has also opened doors to higher-paying opportunities and greater job security.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Skilling that truly pays off </strong></h3>



<p>India’s young population has the power to shape a strong and inclusive future—but only if we invest in the right skills today. Vocational training that matches real-world needs, includes digital tools, and supports young people with care and confidence can open doors to better jobs and brighter lives. </p>



<p>Programmes like Smile Foundation’s <em>STeP</em> and <em>iTrain on Wheels</em> show how practical, hands-on learning can make a real difference, especially for youth from underserved communities. But lasting change needs more partners—governments, companies, and communities working together to make skill-building a priority. </p>



<p>If we want every young person in India to succeed in tomorrow’s workforce, we must start by giving them the tools and support they need today.</p>

<p>When Writer’s Café launched in Gopalapuram, Chennai, in 2016, people were happy to have a space where they could have food for thought as well as food to munch on. What made it (and still makes it) even more remarkable was the fact that the women who manned it were burn survivors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the women, who doused herself in kerosene after a fight with her alcoholic husband, said how she tried to get a job as an office assistant or data entry operator in vain. “People would see my scars and reject me,” she said, till she got vocational training and began working at the café. Today, she is able to support herself and her daughter.</p>



<p>This is a perfect example of how vocational training can empower women. Irrespective of the strata of society they come from, and whether they have college degrees or not, vocational training can help them earn a <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" title="Livelihood" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="608" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">livelihood</a> and live with dignity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Need for vocational training</strong></h2>



<p>Whether it’s manufacturing, construction, retail, healthcare, or IT, many industries in India require skilled workers. Vocational training equips people with specific technical skills needed in these fields.</p>



<p>Vocational courses provide hands-on training that directly translates to the workplace, ensuring workers are better prepared for the demands of their roles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to women, vocational training equips women with practical skills that are in demand across various industries &#8212; tailoring, cosmetology, computer skills, healthcare, or handicrafts. This enables women to enter the workforce or start their own businesses, which leads to financial independence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also increases their employability as they learn skills that employers look for, which can lead to both salaried jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities. Women who are financially independent often gain greater respect and recognition within their families and communities. Vocational training allows women to break traditional gender roles and proves that they can contribute economically, challenging stereotypes and increasing their social status.</p>



<p>“Financial independence empowers women in more ways than one. They will have better bargaining power not just in the workplace but also in their own households. They become part of decision-making even in matters of fertility and reproductive rights,” says Prasanna Gettu, founder and managing trustee, of The International Foundation for Crime Prevention and Victim Care (PCVC), an organisation which creates and extend support services for women and queer individuals affected by domestic and interpersonal violence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At PCVC, economic empowerment is an important vertical in the overall plan for empowerment. “We usually come up with an individual service plan for each woman, and it is drawn up in collaboration with the client. We want her to lead her empowerment and have agency. We encourage women to pursue what they want and based on what they identify as strengths and capabilities,” says Prasanna. Her organisation networks with a lot of organisations who offer vocational training. “Women can learn how to become a mechanic, drive a car, or join the F&amp;B industry. We<strong> </strong>have tie-ups with organisations that offer courses and give them placement.”</p>



<p>Vocational training helps reduce gender inequality by providing women with equal access to opportunities. It helps break the barriers that prevent women from pursuing work outside the home and earning a livelihood.&nbsp; Whether through creating small businesses or providing services that meet the needs of the local community, skilled women contribute to the economic and social well-being of their regions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Studies prove vocational training empowers women</strong></h2>



<p>There are several Indian studies and reports that demonstrate how vocational training plays a crucial role in empowering women. They highlight the positive impact of skill development programmes on women&#8217;s socio-economic status, access to better job opportunities, and overall empowerment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, the National Sample Survey (NSS) provides a broad picture of education and skill development trends in India. According to the NSS 2013 data, women who have received vocational training are more likely to be employed in formal sectors, earn higher wages, and experience better job security than those without such training. The study highlights that vocational training helps women build skills in various sectors such as tailoring, healthcare, IT, and beauty services, enabling them to secure more stable and well-paying jobs.</p>



<p>A study by UNICEF in collaboration with the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), which focused on the impact of skill development programmes on rural women, highlighted that women who participated in vocational training were more likely to start small businesses or enter into formal employment. Vocational training helped women develop skills in areas such as stitching, weaving, and food processing, which improved their economic independence and allowed them to contribute to their family&#8217;s income.</p>



<p>A study conducted by the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) assessed the impact of the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) on women&#8217;s empowerment in rural areas. The findings revealed that women trained under the scheme were able to secure jobs in various sectors such as retail, construction, beauty services, and hospitality, which enhanced their income and economic independence.</p>



<p>Vocational training also gave women the confidence to take leadership roles in their families and communities, challenging traditional gender norms and increasing their participation in decision-making processes. Empowered women were more likely to prioritize the education of their children and improve their family&#8217;s healthcare practices.</p>



<p>Another study conducted by the International Labour Organization (ILO), which focused on gender and vocational training in India, particularly for women in rural and informal sectors, showed that vocational training programmes tailored to women’s needs (such as flexible timings, childcare facilities, and gender-sensitive curriculums) led to increased participation in the workforce. Many women who received vocational training were able to set up their own businesses, such as tailoring, beauty salons, and food services. They were also better equipped to negotiate better wages, working hours, and working conditions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Support from the government&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Various government initiatives focus on providing vocational training to women, especially in rural areas. These programmes are designed to ensure that women have access to resources, guidance, and financial support needed to succeed.</p>



<p>For instance, the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), a flagship scheme, was launched by the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) to provide industry-relevant skill training to youth, including women, across the country. It has a special focus on empowering women by providing skills that can lead to self-employment or better job opportunities. DDU-GKY focuses on the rural youth, including women, by providing skills training in various sectors to make them employable or self-employed. Women beneficiaries are prioritized, and the scheme also emphasizes gender-sensitive training programmes.</p>



<p>The Mahila Coir Yojana is intended to provide self-employment to rural women artisans in regions producing coir fibre. It offers training women in coir processing, and making coir products such as mats, ropes, and carpets. Women artisans are encouraged to start their own coir businesses, enhancing economic independence and the scheme also provides support for entrepreneurship and self-employment.</p>



<p>Local government bodies also often launch initiatives aimed at empowering women through vocational training. According to <em>Times of India</em>, in 2024 Chandigarh municipal corporation along with an NGO conducted a ‘Driving Naari’ programme in Chandigarh to empower women of self-help groups by providing them equal opportunities in the field of driving as a career. It was aimed to empower underprivileged women to become professional drivers and give them access to remunerative “livelihoods with dignity”.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Private initiatives lend a helping hand</strong></h2>



<p>“Vocational training is imperative for anybody as it gives you skills. Even if you don’t have a degree, you have a skill that you can use. In the F&amp;B sector, with the growth it is likely to see in the next five to eight years, human capital is of utmost importance to us,” says Tarun Mahadevan, managing director of Advantage Foods and trustee of Chennai Mission. “In our field you don’t look at educational qualifications, only if you have a skill and, if you don’t, whether you have the attitude to learn a skill.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Nonprofits also help</strong></h2>



<p>As part of Smile Foundation’s <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">educational initiatives</a>, vocational exposure has been encouraged and initiated amongst students to facilitate holistic learning and development by providing a space for students beyond regular curriculum subjects to enable children and youth to make connections between different areas of learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of Smile Foundation’s women empowerment programme <a href="https://donate.smilefoundationindia.org/women-empowerment/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Swabhiman</a>, entrepreneurship and skill development training are provided to women from urban slums and rural areas with limited means owning low scale businesses, giving them access to opportunities for economic empowerment, independence, and leadership. Industry experts join in-house Swabhiman trainers to help the women understand and apply the basics of business and financial management, marketing and communication. They are familiarized with ways and opportunities to scale up and expand their small-scale endeavours to maximize profit and grow as independent, successful entrepreneurs.</p>



<p>The initiative includes identification and selection of women, developing an entrepreneurial ecosystem for women entrepreneurs, building capacity of women to start and run Micro Enterprises (Business idea generation and financial literacy), workshops on E-commerce and digital marketing, technical and entrepreneurial capacity building (Business Plan Finalisation), enrolment in government schemes for livelihood opportunities and setting up Model Micro Enterprises.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>India has embarked on an incredible journey of growth and development ever since its independence in 1947. The country transformed from predominantly being an agrarian economy to building manufacturing capabilities and a robust services industry. In this growth story, one thing that has played a crucial role is infrastructural development. From building roads and dams to establishing schools, hospitals, and railways, infrastructure has been the backbone of India&#8217;s progress, driving economic growth, and improving quality of life.</p>



<p>Owing to the vision of our founding fathers, India invested heavily in infrastructural development in the decades following independence. This included the expansion of national highways and railway networks, the building of <strong>major dams like Bhakra Nangal</strong>, and the establishment of premium institutions like the IITs and AIIMS. In recent decades, we have also seen a focus on urban infrastructure development with projects like Metro Rail, tunnels, and much more. Thus, as India enters a new era, it needs to continue focusing on building stronger infrastructural capabilities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Infrastructural Needs for India</strong></h2>



<p>There are many areas in which India can focus. But, here are a few key areas that require consistent attention for the holistic development of Indian urban as well as rural communities:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Road Network: </strong>For any economy to grow, mobility of movement is most important. This is why expanding a robust road network in the form of national and state highways, expressways, etc., needs to be a priority. India&#8217;s ambitious <em><a href="https://www.india.gov.in/spotlight/bharatmala-pariyojana-stepping-stone-towards-new-india" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">Bharatmala Pariyojana</a></em> aims to develop 83,677 kilometres of highways, improving connectivity in remote and underserved regions.</li>



<li><strong>Dams</strong>: As the requirements of the country’s growing population increase, there will be a bigger need for water management, electricity generation, irrigation facilities, and much more. This is where building new dams can be a game-changer. Apart from that, India is also focusing on river-linking projects aimed at diverting water from areas that experience flooding to those areas that are affected by drought.</li>



<li><strong>Educational Institutions: </strong>The Indian government has been working sincerely towards expanding the number of AIIMS and IITs in the country. In addition, <strong>new universities, schools, and colleges need to be built.</strong> Existing institutions also need an infrastructural boost in the form of smart upgrades to make them relevant.</li>



<li><strong>Hospitals: </strong>A large part of the Indian population is deprived, even today, of good quality healthcare facilities, as most of the big hospitals are concentrated in urban areas<strong> forcing rural and tribal populations to flock to cities like Chandigarh, Delhi, Hyderabad, etc.,</strong> for receiving adequate health support. However, this is not sustainable, and the country needs to work on expanding its healthcare network. This can also be done through the development of digital infrastructure like telemedicine facilities, mobile hospitals, etc.</li>



<li><strong>Railways:</strong> This is arguably the lifeline of India; even today because of the reach and affordability, lakhs of Indians travel through railways. This is the reason why the government must keep pushing for the expansion of railways in regions where it hasn’t yet reached. The recent expansion of the railway network to <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/on-republic-day-eve-vande-bharat-express-touches-base-in-kashmir-for-first-time/article69140341.ece" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">Srinagar in Kashmir </a>and the building of the world&#8217;s highest railway bridge is a good example of it. Apart from this, another way of improving the mobility of Indians is by building more airports across the country and making air travel affordable for the masses.</li>



<li><strong>Other infrastructure: </strong>In addition to roads, dams, schools, hospitals, and railways, other critical infrastructure includes airports, ports, and digital connectivity. Developing world-class airports and ports can boost trade and tourism, while expanding digital infrastructure ensures access to information and services, bridging the digital divide.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Needs and Aspirations</strong></h2>



<p>As India continues to grow and evolve, it is essential to focus on the future needs and aspirations of the population. Here are some key areas where India should continue investing in infrastructure:</p>



<p><strong>Sustainable Development:</strong> While developing infrastructure is essential, what is also needed is a focus on sustainability. As India moves forward, it also needs to play an important role in establishing itself as a climate-conscious nation. Therefore, the country should focus on investing in <strong>environment-friendly practices and investing in renewable energy.</strong> India is already on the path of building these capabilities. It needs to continue building on these efforts.</p>



<p><strong>Healthcare expansion: </strong>As discussed above, India still faces a major challenge when it comes to providing equitable access to good quality healthcare facilities to its population. The COVID-19 pandemic also revealed many loopholes in India’s healthcare infrastructure. There, it is essential that all the stakeholders work together in building facilities for all Indians. Digital solutions are going to play a crucial role in this. Policies like universal health insurance are also going to ease the burden on the poorer masses.</p>



<p><strong>Digital connectivity</strong>: Expanding digital infrastructure is critical for bridging the digital divide and ensuring access to information and services. Initiatives like Digital India aim to provide high-speed internet connectivity to rural and remote areas, enabling digital literacy, e-governance, and digital financial inclusion.</p>



<p><strong>Educational Infrastructure: </strong>Investing in educational infrastructure at all levels, from primary schools to higher education institutions, is essential for fostering innovation and human capital development. Enhancing vocational training centers and skill development programs can equip the workforce in India with the necessary skills for a rapidly changing job market.</p>



<p><strong>Transportation and logistics: </strong>Developing efficient transportation and logistics infrastructure can boost trade and economic growth. Expanding the railway network, modernizing ports and airports, and improving last-mile connectivity are critical for enhancing India&#8217;s competitiveness in the global market.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>For major economies like the United States, Europe, China, etc., infrastructural development has played a central role in their development and growth. These countries continue to invest heavily in further enhancing their capabilities. For example, China’s Belt and Road Initiative is aimed at establishing its dominance in trade around the world. Similarly, Japan’s focus on technology has made it a leader in this area.</p>



<p>As India continues its journey towards becoming a global economic powerhouse, investing in infrastructure remains a critical priority. By focusing on sustainable development, healthcare, digital connectivity, education, and transportation, India can build a stronger and more resilient nation that meets the needs and aspirations of its people. Infrastructural development is not just about building physical structures; it is about creating opportunities, improving quality of life, and fostering social and economic progress.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smile’s Contribution</strong></h3>



<p>Smile Foundation helps develop infrastructure primarily by improving <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education </a>and <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">healthcare</a> facilities in underserved areas. We support the construction and renovation of schools, learning centers, and healthcare units, ensuring access to quality education and medical services. Additionally, we provide necessary resources like furniture, clean drinking water, sanitation facilities, and technology to create a more conducive learning and healthcare environment. </p>



<p><strong>1. Mobile Healthcare Units:</strong> In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Smile Foundation expanded its healthcare infrastructure by launching additional <strong>Smile on Wheels </strong>mobile healthcare units across India. These units deliver primary healthcare services to underserved populations, covering urban slums and rural areas.

<p>Vocational courses provide a pathway to employment. These courses equip students with specific skill sets suited to particular jobs or industries, helping them secure employment. This, in turn, boosts the country’s economy.<br>However, according to a report, there are not enough takers for vocational and skill-based subjects in government schools in Delhi, with some reporting near-zero enrolment. The Directorate of <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2412" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Education</a> has issued show-cause notices to 606 government schools due to their poor enrolment figures. Schools with fewer than 20 students were asked to explain the reasons behind the low enrolment and the steps they were taking to boost student participation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Vocational courses increase employability</strong></h2>



<p> <strong>These courses fill a skill gap. </strong>Many industries in India, such as manufacturing, construction, retail, healthcare, and IT, require skilled workers. Vocational training equips people with specific technical skills needed in these fields. Higher education often focuses largely on theoretical knowledge, leaving a gap in practical, job-ready skills. </p>



<p>Vocational courses provide<strong> hands-on training </strong>that directly translates to the workplace, ensuring workers are better prepared for the demands of their roles. By offering vocational courses, India can bridge the gap between the demand for skilled workers and the limited supply of trained professionals.<br>This is important, as the current scenario is rather bleak. According to the India Skills Report 2020, the youth employment rate has remained stagnant for the past three years. According to UNICEF and the Education Commission, more than 50% of Indian youth will lack the education and skills necessary for employment by 2030.</p>



<p><em>Magdalene Jeyarathnam</em>, founder-director of the East West Centre for Counselling, says the educational curriculum has become redundant over the years as it is not geared to help students enter the job market. “The curriculum is based on what was taught in the past, and changes are made with the next couple of years in mind, not what the need will be five years or more from now,” says Magdalene, who conducts courses in expressive arts therapy and psychodrama in colleges, as UGC guidelines mandate that UG and PG students have skill certification. “When students gain skill-based certificates, it adds to the degree they earn,” she says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fuels entrepreneurship, empowers women<br></strong></h3>



<p>Vocational training provides an impetus to entrepreneurship, as it empowers individuals to start their own businesses. For example, courses in carpentry, tailoring, or beauty and wellness can help individuals set up their own small businesses, creating job opportunities for others. It also provides opportunities for individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from rural areas or lower-income families, who may not have the resources to pursue higher education.</p>



<p>Many skilled workers migrate from rural areas to urban areas in search of jobs. Vocational courses can be offered<strong> locally to help retain talent within their communities.</strong> This can reduce migration pressure on cities, create opportunities in rural areas, and encourage balanced regional development.<br>Vocational training also<strong> empowers women</strong>, offering them the chance to acquire skills in areas such as beauty, tailoring, or hospitality. These skills can be applied in flexible working environments, allowing women to become financially independent.</p>



<p><br>“I was able to start my own beauty parlour in a gated community two years ago after completing a beautician course,” says K Saroj, who lives in Medavakkam, Chennai. “I couldn’t go to college because my family couldn’t afford it, but now I can earn well and ensure my children can study in good schools.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Vocational courses alleviate pressure on the traditional education system</strong></h4>



<p><strong><br></strong> Since colleges and universities have limited seats, vocational training offers an alternative pathway for those who may not want to pursue a degree or those who lack the financial resources to access such education. Vocational training is often<strong> less expensive and quicker to complete than a traditional degree</strong>, making it an attractive option for students who want to begin working sooner, without incurring heavy debt or spending many years in school.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Government initiatives prioritise vocational education</strong></h5>



<p>The National Education Policy (NEP), 2020, focuses on integrating vocational education into mainstream education across all boards in India. It aims for at least 50% of school and higher education students to have access to vocational education by 2025, emphasising industry linkages and demand-driven courses.</p>



<p><br>The National Skill Training Institute (NSTI) and Industrial Training Institutes (ITI) are government institutes that offer vocational courses. The National Council for Vocational Education and Training (NCVET) is another government organisation that supports vocational education in India.</p>



<p><strong>Why are there few takers?<br></strong> According to a 2020 report, there are not many takers for vocational courses in schools. In 2020, only 1,247 students opted for the vocational stream, while there were 1,755 seats in 18 skill courses offered in government schools in Chandigarh. Some skill courses received fewer than two applications.</p>



<p><br>Experts attribute this to several factors. Many schools lack essential infrastructure, such as laboratories and equipment. For instance, students enrolled in IT courses often want to use computers, which are frequently unavailable. Even in schools that do have labs, these facilities are not equipped to handle high enrolment numbers.</p>



<p><br>Since government schools often operate on tight budgets, vocational courses are not always a priority when funds are allocated. “Often, schools don’t have the financial resources to invest in modern training equipment, qualified trainers, or the development of new courses,” says a trainer at a government institute who wishes to remain anonymous.</p>



<p><br>There is also a <strong>shortage of qualified trainers and teachers with both industry experience and teaching ability</strong>. Government schools often struggle to recruit and retain instructors who not only have technical expertise but also understand the latest industry trends and can impart these to students.</p>



<p><br>These trainers also often don’t have access to regular training or professional development opportunities, which is essential to keep up with changing industry demands or new technologies. This results in outdated teaching methods and poor curriculum.</p>



<p><br>Another major challenge is the lack of linkage between vocational training providers (schools) and industries. Practical training, internships, and apprenticeships are crucial for vocational education, but government schools often lack partnerships with companies or local businesses where students can gain real-world experience. Institutes also fail to provide adequate job placement assistance or guidance, leaving students struggling to find employment after completing the courses.</p>



<p><br>There is also an inherent social bias towards vocational education in India, where it is often seen as a last resort for students who cannot pursue traditional academic education. Many students, parents, and even educators view vocational courses as inferior or less prestigious than university degrees, which discourages students. Many students and parents are also unaware of the benefits of vocational education, and that it can lead to lucrative career opportunities.</p>



<p><br>“When my son enrolled for an ITI course, all my relatives and friends felt that he should opt for a regular professional course and attend a reputed college or university,” says Vijayalakshmi Narasimhan, who works in a bank. “But he is doing well now and is happy with the profession he chose.”</p>



<p><br>Vocational training is often seen as separate from the traditional academic curriculum. Students may have to choose between academic subjects and vocational courses, leading to a divided education system. Integrating vocational education within the general school system can help normalise it and make it more attractive to students.</p>



<p><strong>Lack of recognition, dropout rates pose roadblocks<br></strong> In many cases, vocational courses lack formal recognition or accreditation by industry bodies or professional associations. This reduces the credibility of the courses and the value of the qualifications awarded, making it difficult for students to find employers who recognise their training.<br>Many students who begin vocational courses often drop out due to a variety of factors such as lack of interest, societal pressure to pursue academic education, or because they do not see immediate benefits from completing the course.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smile Foundation steps in</strong></h2>



<p>Smile Foundation’s <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">STeP programme</a> works in line with government policies to bridge the gap and address the challenges involved in implementing vocational education courses. As part of our educational initiatives, vocational exposure has been encouraged and initiated among students to facilitate holistic learning and development by providing a space for students beyond regular curriculum subjects. This helps children and youth make connections between different areas of learning. </p>



<p>Our skill training and livelihood programme is closely aligned with the <a href="https://www.skillindiadigital.gov.in/home" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">‘Skill India’</a> initiative of the Government of India. We aim to empower individuals with relevant and in-demand skills through specialised training courses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Technological advancements and global economic shifts are redefining job markets and it has become crucial to reassess educational strategies. Particularly in rural India, traditional education systems often focus heavily on theoretical knowledge, neglecting practical skill development that can provide real-life benefits. The inclusion of vocational training and skill development in school curriculums for rural children can bridge this gap and equip them with the tools necessary to thrive in the modern workforce. With nearly 70% of India’s population residing in rural areas, the need for relevant and accessible education has never been greater.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://thewire.in/labour/nearly-81-of-the-employed-in-india-are-in-the-informal-sector-ilo" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">2018 report</a>, nearly 80% of the employed in India are in informal sectors, often with limited education or skills. This trend underscores the importance of integrating vocational skills early in a child’s educational journey to provide them with more opportunities for stable, rewarding livelihoods.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Global Perspective</strong></h2>



<p>Vocational training is not a new concept. It has been embraced worldwide as an effective way to prepare young people for the demands of the labor market. Countries like Germany, Switzerland, and Singapore have long been pioneers in integrating skill-based learning into their education systems. In these nations, vocational training is considered equally valuable as academic education, with students gaining hands-on experience in various trades, from healthcare to engineering, agriculture to digital skills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, in Switzerland, students undergo rigorous vocational training as part of their high school curriculum, with more than 70% of young people entering vocational tracks. Such systems have led to stronger labor markets and greater social stability, and they offer a roadmap for India to follow.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Role of Vocational Training in Rural India</strong></h2>



<p>In India, the Government of India has made significant strides toward vocational education through initiatives such as the National <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" title="Livelihood" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="667" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Skill Development</a> Mission (NSDM) and Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY). These programs aim to provide training to the youth and help them develop skills that are directly aligned with industry requirements. However, the gap between these initiatives and rural children remains substantial. Nearly <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/jobs-career/education-80-youth-in-rural-india-are-yet-to-pursue-vocational-training-emphasising-a-significant-skills-gap-surveynbsp-3338313/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">80% of rural youth</a> in India are yet to receive vocational or skill training, underscoring a major skills gap. Consequently, around <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/40-rural-youth-struggle-for-jobs-over-lack-of-skills-language-proficiency-125021101484_1.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">40% of rural youth face difficulties</a> in securing employment, primarily due to a lack of necessary skills.</p>



<p>Integrating vocational training into rural school curriculums can bridge the skills gap and enhance employment opportunities. With limited access to higher education, rural students could gain marketable skills in areas like modern farming, food processing, and animal husbandry—essential for improving agricultural productivity. Additionally, digital literacy is crucial as digital jobs are rapidly expanding. However,<a href="https://niitfoundation.org/bridging-the-digital-divide-empowering-rural-india/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> rural youth often lack internet access and exposure to digital tools</a>. Incorporating digital skills in education can help them stay competitive in the job market and explore new income opportunities, ensuring they are better prepared for the evolving workforce.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Role of NEP 2020</strong></h2>



<p>The <a href="https://ijeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ijeks-03-07-038.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">National Education Policy (NEP) 2020</a> has significantly emphasized integrating vocational and skill training into India&#8217;s school curriculum to bridge the gap between education and employability. It mandates the inclusion of vocational education from secondary school level, enabling students to gain hands-on experience through internships and skill-based learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a focus on industry-relevant skills, including digital literacy, agriculture, and entrepreneurship, NEP 2020 aims to prepare students for diverse career pathways. By promoting a multidisciplinary approach and integrating emerging technologies, the policy seeks to enhance job readiness and empower students, especially in rural areas, with practical skills.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>But, What are the Challenges?</strong></h2>



<p>Despite its benefits, the integration of vocational training into rural school curriculums faces several challenges. One of the primary barriers is the lack of infrastructure and qualified trainers in rural areas. Many schools are under-resourced, with limited access to facilities such as workshops, computers, or even internet connectivity. Moreover, teachers may lack the expertise to effectively deliver vocational training in fields such as agriculture, technology, or construction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cultural bias against vocational education also remains a significant hurdle. In many parts of India, traditional academic education is seen as a more prestigious path, while vocational training is often associated with lower-status jobs.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Overcoming Barriers to Implementation</strong></h3>



<p>To address this, a shift in societal attitudes is essential. It is critical to raise awareness about the value of vocational skills and their role in the modern economy. Government and community efforts must focus on making vocational education appealing to both students and parents by showcasing success stories and demonstrating the long-term benefits of such training.</p>



<p>Additionally, partnerships with the private sector could play a crucial role in overcoming some of these barriers. Collaborations with industries and companies can help align school curriculums with the skills required in the job market. By involving local businesses in shaping the curriculum, vocational training can become more relevant and better suited to the needs of the rural economy. Technology can also be leveraged to bridge gaps in access and expertise. Online platforms and remote learning programs could provide rural children with access to high-quality educational resources and digital skills training, even in the absence of physical infrastructure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smile’s Work</strong></h2>



<p>Smile Foundation is actively engaged in integrating vocational training and skill development into the education of rural children through several initiatives:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow"><strong>Mission Education</strong></a><strong> Program</strong>: This initiative addresses the educational needs of underserved children, including those in rural areas. It emphasizes not only academic learning but also life skills and vocational training to ensure holistic development. For instance, in Cholanayakanahalli, Bangalore, the program serves communities below the poverty line, where most children are first-generation learners. </li>



<li><strong>Vocational Training Centers</strong>: Smile Foundation establishes centers that provide practical, hands-on training aligned with industry standards. These centers focus on digital literacy and other relevant skills, ensuring that rural youth are prepared for modern job markets. </li>



<li><strong>Digital Literacy Programs</strong>: Recognizing the importance of technology, the foundation implements digital literacy initiatives to ensure rural youth are comfortable with technology, thereby enhancing their employability. </li>



<li><strong>Public-Private Partnerships</strong>: Smile Foundation fosters collaborations to create apprenticeship and internship opportunities, promoting entrepreneurship among rural youth. </li>



<li><strong>Shiksha Na Ruke Initiative</strong>: This program includes vocational education and skill training as key interventions, aiming to promote socio-emotional well-being and infrastructure development in government schools.</li>
</ol>



<p>Through these efforts, Smile Foundation aims to empower rural children by equipping them with practical skills, thereby enhancing their employment opportunities and contributing to sustainable development.</p>



<p>By embracing vocational education, we can provide rural youth with the tools to succeed, whether through formal employment or entrepreneurial ventures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, this vision can only be realized through collaborative efforts from government bodies, non-governmental organizations, educational institutions, industries, and communities. When executed effectively, vocational training can transform the lives of millions of rural children, ensuring that they are not left behind in the global race toward development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Information Technology (IT) and IT-enabled Services (ITeS) have played a critical role in the development of India&#8217;s economic landscape. It provides a diverse array of courses that are tailored to the changing needs of the global digital economy. The Indian IT-ITES industry was virtually non-existent prior to the mid-1990s, but has since emerged as a significant global actor. In order to remain at the forefront of the digital landscape&#8217;s rapid evolution, professionals are striving to leverage the power of cutting-edge skills and expertise. The government of India promotes the active development of digital skills among stakeholders through a variety of programmes (<a href="https://nulm.gov.in/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">NULM</a>, <a href="https://www.pmkvyofficial.org/pmkvy2/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">PMKVY</a>, etc.).</p>



<p>The Skill India Mission (SIM) is a well-organised and well-equipped initiative representing a new technical <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2382" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> direction. With a focus on the overall technological development of the country, it offers a variety of skill-related training programmes, starting with computer applications, tailored to the needs of various government and private institutions. It also equips the Indian workforce with the requisite skills to enable them to become self-sufficient and employable, as recognised by the Government of India. The initiative was aimed at&nbsp;establishing a pool of qualified workers who could help fuel the country&#8217;s economic expansion.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Indian Scenario</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.sscnasscom.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Sector Skill Council (SSC) NASSCOM</a> is the national standard-setting entity for IT Skills, established under the auspices of the Ministry of Skills Development &amp; Entrepreneurship and the National Skill Development Corporation. With its various alliances and initiatives it provides students with the advanced skills that are indispensable in the swiftly changing digital environment of the present day; assistance in securing employment with certification from an industry; upskill students for the future in terms of new-age skills and employment opportunities; keep track of the most recent government initiatives.</p>



<p><a href="https://in.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/courses-in-it" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Universities and educational institutions</a> collaborate with SSC NASSCOM to provide students with programmes that serve as either an elective course to an existing course or an add-on programme. Such alliances offer opportunities for all kinds of students from various backgrounds and capabilities. SSC NASSCOM develops pertinent academic programmes for students and organises training sessions for faculty members at universities or colleges that are involved in this initiative. Additionally, SSC NASSCOM offers guidelines and recommendations regarding programme specifics, including infrastructure for training and evaluation, faculty selection and student selection. To make the courses more inclusive and accessible, they are often free of charge and cater to a diverse range of interests, from basic computer skills to programming, website designing and cyber security, and more.</p>



<p>Multiple prestigious institutions in India are recognised for their IT and ITeS programmes, with tougher standards of seeking admission.&nbsp;Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) provide exceptional engineering and technology education with an emphasis on research and innovation.&nbsp;Private universities&nbsp;such as BITS Pilani and VIT provide specialised programmes that are designed to align with the most recent industry trends. With comprehensive courses, these institutes produce professionals who stand out and succeed globally</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lack of Employability</strong></h2>



<p>Even with suitable government programmes in place to help learners flourish in a technologically interconnected world, the youth&#8217;s lack of employability remains a major concern.</p>



<p>Employability will continue to be a challenge in the absence of sufficient computer skills. In order to effectively promote employability, the Skill India movement would need to refocus its efforts on the new path. In India, there are numerous computer science graduates who are currently unemployed due to the fact that the skills they have acquired are insufficient or that they require reskilling with the emerging and significant skills in the current industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, there is a growing trend among young people to pursue skill sets in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, cybersecurity, and data science and analytics. However, state-funded courses frequently emphasise conventional skills, including basic programming, data entry, and customer support (voice and non-voice).&nbsp;As a result, it is&nbsp;necessary to broaden one&#8217;s skill set to encompass Data Science, Analytics, and related fields.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Need for Collaboration</strong></h2>



<p>It is imperative that the government and the industry collaborate efficiently. A critical measure in addressing the lack of employability is to improve industry collaboration in the design of course curricula to address the immediate requirements of the market. The curriculum can be rendered more pertinent to the industry&#8217;s requirements by enhancing industry-academia engagement, thereby allowing service providers to reduce their initial training expenses and cultivate a competent workforce. The endeavour must be more comprehensive and should involve partnerships with educational and training institutes in both major and smaller cities. This will involve assisting them in the development of the curriculum, providing faculty training in both relevant content and teaching methodologies, offering internships, and establishing their own training schools. Additionally, it is imperative that IT companies, particularly those of a larger scale, investigate the potential of utilising their substantial cash reserves to establish a sustainable educational system that is in accordance with industry requirements.<br><br>Furthermore, the industry should collaborate with academic institutions to ensure that the curriculum is periodically updated to ensure its relevance. In order to maintain its competitive advantage over other outsourcing destinations, India must establish a strong partnership between the government and the industry.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smile Foundation and IT-ITeS Sector</strong></h3>



<p>Smile Foundation’s <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Smile Twin e-Learning Programme (STeP)</a></strong> in Bangalore is empowering underserved youth by bridging the gap between skills and employment opportunities in the <strong>IT-ITeS sector</strong>. Started in <strong>June 2024</strong>, this initiative equips youth with <strong>hands-on IT-ITES skills</strong> critical for success in today’s job market. Supported by a curriculum developed in collaboration with <strong>NSDC and NASSCOM</strong>, it addresses industry-specific needs to prepare students for dynamic roles in the tech sector. The courses combine technical skill-building with <strong>professional development</strong> to boost employability and open doors to sustainable career pathways.</p>



<p>By nurturing young talents, Smile Foundation continues its mission of creating sustainable livelihoods for low-income communities and contributing to India&#8217;s growing IT-ITeS industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As per the <a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/unemployment-crisis-83-of-jobless-indians-are-youth-says-international-labour-organisation-report-11711517084127.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">India Employment Report 2024</a>, which was jointly published by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the Institute of Human Development (IHD), the youth of India are still struggling with the country&#8217;s increasing unemployment rates. Specifically, nearly 83% of the unemployed population are part of this demographic. Despite the increase in skill development programmes and the expansion of the educational infrastructure, a substantial number of young Indians are still unemployed. This is a significant obstacle, and there is some&nbsp;hindrance in&nbsp;obtaining meaningful and productive employment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic compounded the issues facing youth in the labour market. Although there was some recovery following the lockdowns, it was marked by a spike in substandard work.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Disparity Between Industry Demand and Skills</strong></h2>



<p>Comprehending&nbsp;the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/how-india-can-bridge-talent-and-skill-gaps-in-key-emerging-sectors/articleshow/112570187.cms?from=mdr" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">discrepancies between industry demand and skills</a> is critical&nbsp;in order to develop a workforce that is adequately equipped to navigate the economy of the future. Digital capabilities are&nbsp;surpassing the current capabilities of the workforce. Frequently, young people are unable to determine the abilities they require for future employment opportunities. Academic curricula must train them to know how to navigate the job market and prepare them for the relevant jobs. Educational curriculum should also&nbsp;be more closely aligned with industry requirements. The employability of graduates could be substantially enhanced if institutions were to collaborate closely with industries to develop courses that were more pertinent.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Structural Issues in Employment&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>With India&#8217;s growing youth population, the formal work sector has not kept up. The youth workforce frequently ends up working on a contract basis or in the informal economy with no stability. This also leads to many people working in industries unrelated to their degree or in jobs that do not allow them to make the most of their educational background. In the case of government posts, thousands apply for a small number of positions, and only a handful are selected. Furthermore, many government jobs require giving competitive tests for which not all candidates are prepared. Then, due to the amount of paperwork, or bureaucracy, many young people are unable to pursue such careers. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Concentration of Jobs in the Services Sector</strong></h3>



<p>The <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/whats-behind-high-joblessness-among-indias-youth/a-68721599" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">growth observed in recent decades</a> has largely been fuelled by the rapid development of India&#8217;s services sector, which is less labour-intensive compared to the manufacturing sector. Inclusive growth necessitates the swift creation of employment opportunities at the lower end of the economic spectrum, rather than solely focussing on higher wage and skill levels.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Unemployment Due to Technological Advancements</strong></h3>



<p>Technological advancements present a risk of automation, potentially leading to significant job losses. The advent of artificial intelligence and high-precision robotics poses an unprecedented threat to cognitive skills, resulting in a heightened level of concern compared to prior technological advancements. Automation does create new opportunities; however, it simultaneously heightens the demand for highly skilled workers in emerging roles. Furthermore, securing employment in such positions poses challenges for many young individuals, particularly those from rural backgrounds.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What&#8217;s the Impact on Women?</strong></h3>



<p>The IHD/ILO report indicated that a greater proportion of educated unemployed youth were women (76.7%) compared to men (62.2%). India has one of the lowest female labour force participation rates globally, approximately 25%. The absence of a comprehensive care economy, characterised by insufficient affordable childcare and family support, alongside inadequate infrastructure policies, rigid social norms, and a shortage in necessary skills are&nbsp;constant obstacles for women that hinder their participation in the workforce.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Absence of Jobs in Small Towns and Rural Areas</strong></h3>



<p>Individuals from small towns and rural regions often have to relocate to larger cities in pursuit of improved employment opportunities. Private employment opportunities are absent in their hometowns. Furthermore, these youth&nbsp;must contend with candidates who have received their <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2323" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> from more prestigious and recognised institutions located in the cities, which lessens their chances of getting jobs. There is a necessity to develop initiatives that generate local employment in sectors such as agriculture, textiles, housing, healthcare and education.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Government Employment Initiatives</strong></h3>



<p>The Government of India has implemented various schemes and programs designed to generate employment and enhance employability across multiple sectors. Initiatives include the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana (PMRPY), Skill India Mission, and Startup India.<br>Administrative processes and laws frequently result in delays in the execution of projects and heightened costs.<br><br>The lack of strong support systems for <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" title="Livelihood" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="655" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">skill development</a> and entrepreneurship is another significant factor leading to the outcome of government employment initiatives. The quality of skill training provided through various schemes frequently does not meet industry requirements, leaving beneficiaries inadequately prepared for the job market. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Doing Our Bit</strong></h3>



<p>Re-skilling and continuous learning initiatives should be promoted, especially in light of rapid technology improvements. A reduction in gender imbalance is also required. More areas, such as energy, transportation, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), should create work opportunities for women. <a href="https://donate.smilefoundationindia.org/donate-for-livelihood/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Skilling and livelihood</a> programmes of different entities including nonprofits like <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Smile Foundation</a> should be customised to specific area and sector needs and more emphasis should be placed on guaranteeing that rural youths have equal chances as those who live in cities.</p>
