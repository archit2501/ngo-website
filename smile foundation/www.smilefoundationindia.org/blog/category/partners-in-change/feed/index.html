<p>&#8220;Business has a responsibility beyond its basic responsibility to its shareholders; a responsibility to a broader constituency that includes its key stakeholders: customers, employees, NGOs, government &#8211; the people of the communities in which it operates.&#8221;</p>

<p>Corporate Social Responsibility in India has shifted from being viewed as an obligation to becoming a strategic enabler of sustainable growth. With Section 135 of the Companies Act making CSR mandatory, corporates now leverage purpose-driven NGO partnerships to achieve measurable outcomes. These collaborations embed ethics, innovation and accountability, fostering resilient communities and driving long-term societal transformation. In crux, one can understand the world of CSR through the <a href="https://jcsr.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40991-016-0004-6#:~:text=The%20four%2Dpart%20definitional%20framework%20for%20CSR,(Carroll%201979%2C%201991)." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Caroll’s pyramid of CSR </a>which defines responsibility across four layers- economic, legal, ethical and philanthropic.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeoJ2qX3KbYrJevJhXn81A7O7MbbWpn8Y6bgqaFLTd6ugDM8XdDhSgNoTLD6sARokM1ZSnuEiNNXGks7DmX-avsA5PoeFe3O-eJGrpL737ho0UZgps47D7iL4cwymbdTWL459Lj?key=RPmeM3Vvhk_I35cd56003g" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-csr-and-indian-businesses"><strong>CSR and Indian businesses</strong></h2>



<p>India’s business landscape experienced a transformation since 1990s. Industries expanded globally, driving impressive growth in sales and market share. Yet, alongside this progress came the realisation that unchecked expansion risked resource overuse and environmental strain. At the same time, as the bond between businesses and consumers deepened, it became clear that this relationship must also extend to supporting the communities that sustain them, thereby contributing to the holistic development of the nation.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Importance of CSR in India</strong></li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Globalisation</strong><br>Global trade and integrated supply chains have heightened expectations around fair labour practices, environmental stewardship and community welfare. Forward-looking companies now embrace CSR partnerships not only to comply with emerging regulations but also to build resilience, enhance market access and secure long-term growth.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>International guidelines</strong><br>Global frameworks such as the <a href="https://www.in.kpmg.com/pdf/csr_whitepaper.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">UN Global Compact and SA8000 </a>encourage corporates to align with universally accepted principles on human rights, the environment and anti-corruption. While advisory, these standards have significantly influenced CSR in India, motivating corporates to collaborate through CSR NGO partnerships that deliver practical, scalable solutions to social challenges.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Corporates as brands</strong><br>Corporates are no longer isolated economic actors but vital pillars of society. By embedding strategic CSR partnerships into their core, businesses in India are moving beyond traditional philanthropy to drive purposeful, lasting change. This alignment of profitability with social impact not only strengthens corporate reputation but also builds enduring trust with stakeholders.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcw9m8Ms01L-YojVaJjtTBK22sYktXKW72lzqdw9ytC2EWIPMMuxR8X6gbjFNkODytrD5qYAUviKT-xgbokJpt9iROCbdqz8EGpeivlSEn6u2mKGvfc2ZCX95bJEKDOK9vSSrPN?key=RPmeM3Vvhk_I35cd56003g" alt=""/></figure>



<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Strategic alignment with business goals </strong></li>
</ol>



<p>As per Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013 companies are supposed to allocate <strong>2% of average </strong>net profits towards social development. But, if one looks closely, the responsibility is not just monetarily, but in aligning CSR activities with broader business strategies. </p>



<p>Corporates through CSR partnerships establish a long term investment in sustainability. When companies integrate CSR laws into their core business models, they achieve a dual purpose of contributing to national development while also enforcing their own competitiveness. </p>



<p>For example, when a healthcare company invests in <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">rural healthcare initiatives</a> under CSR, they not only fulfils compliance but also builds trust within the communities, expands market reach and promotes a healthier customer base. </p>



<p>CSR is perceived as shared value creation, where profitability and social well being move hand in hand. It strengthens </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Brand reputation&nbsp;</strong></li>



<li><strong>Improves stakeholder trust</strong></li>



<li><strong>Enhances risk management&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Thereby, proving that structured CSR partnerships with NGOs enable effective last mile delivery and measurable impact.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcolSnIsgQygteE12CkmvpwVOgHM_vgZ6pDd3icaoJvlnRLnSdz3pJj48jVU8drBtuRaaOhnun3Ax2c5c0VsUjTG1IafgSotjjHZjNYPiA7r-ZsZo9MT41iB1dCARbUzWx6DoN9Bg?key=RPmeM3Vvhk_I35cd56003g" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Handbook on Corporate Social Responsibility in India (Source: PwC</strong>)</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-left"></p>



<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Community-centric approach </strong></li>
</ol>



<p><a href="https://www.pwc.in/assets/pdfs/publications/2013/handbook-on-corporate-social-responsibility-in-india.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"></a>One of the most critical shifts in Corporate Social Responsibility practice in India has been the movement from top-down philanthropy to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/02560909221094379" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">co-created community led models of development</a>.  According to the Journal of Business Perspective, 2022 research has shown that CSR initiatives designed with active community participation achieve greater relevance, sustainability and long term acceptance. </p>



<p>By involving local stakeholders in identifying challenges and shaping solutions, companies design interventions rooted in real needs and cultural contexts, making them more effective and sustainable. This participatory approach then fosters trust, ownership and stewardship, enabling communities to continue initiatives beyond the funding cycles. </p>



<p>On the other hand, NGOs in India play a vital role in bridging the gaps between the grassroot communities and corporates; by translating corporate intent into grassroots action through network and credibility. Thus showcasing that corporates, NGOs and communities can create purpose-driven partnerships that deliver inclusive scalability and ensure social change across India.</p>



<ol start="4" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Sustainability &amp; environmental responsibility &#8211; Focus areas</strong></li>
</ol>



<p><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/Strategy%20and%20Corporate%20Finance/Our%20Insights/Five%20ways%20that%20ESG%20creates%20value/Five-ways-that-ESG-creates-value.ashx" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">ESG driven CSR</a> demonstrates that companies integrating environmental, social and governance priorities enhance long term value creation rather than compromise it. Governance strengthens accountability, environmental projects deliver sustainability and the social dimension delivers the most immediate impact on the marginalised communities of India. By investing in the following focus areas, corporates can optimise their CSR goals with long term sustainability.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Education and skill development<br></strong>Education unlocks human potential and transforms communities. Initiatives that combine quality learning with vocational training equip children and youth to rise above poverty, secure dignified employment and contribute to society’s progress.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Healthcare and sanitation<br></strong>Accessible healthcare and sanitation protect both dignity and life. Mobile health units, preventive care and hygiene awareness bring critical services closer to underserved communities, ensuring healthier families and resilient futures.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Livelihood enhancement<br></strong>Sustainable livelihoods empower individuals with independence and dignity. Skill-building programmes and entrepreneurship opportunities create pathways out of poverty, enabling families to thrive and communities to achieve long-term social and economic stability.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Environmental sustainability<br></strong>Safeguarding the environment is central to future prosperity. Community-led conservation, water stewardship and sustainable practices inspire people to live in balance with nature, protecting resources for generations to come.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Women’s health and empowerment<br></strong>When women thrive, communities prosper. Focused interventions in nutrition, healthcare, education and skills give women the tools to lead healthier lives, access opportunities and uplift families and entire communities.</li>
</ul>



<ol start="5" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Scalability and innovation</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Smart CSR enabled by data and technology drives transparency and measurable outcomes. This systemic approach enables corporates to scale solutions, replicate success and address root causes of social challenges. By aligning innovation with impact, CSR in India is now evolving towards a future ready ecosystem delivering sustainable and verifiable results. </p>



<p>For example, tech-enabled CSR solutions are transforming impact delivery with AI enhancing education and healthcare while digital financial inclusion fosters equitable and sustainable growth</p>



<ol start="6" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Impact measurement and transparency</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Impact measurement in CSR is evolving through technology with AI enabling precise data collection, real time monitoring and transparent reporting. For business and communities, this integration ensures accountability, drives efficiency and scales sustainable solutions making technology-driven impact assessment integral to purpose led growth in India’s CSR landscape</p>



<ol start="7" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Emerging trends in CSR and CSR partnerships</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Corporate Social Responsibility in India has matured from philanthropy into a strategic tool for community transformation. To remain effective, corporates must align with emerging CSR trends that shape long-term impact:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Shift to strategic CSR partnerships</strong> – Moving beyond transactional funding towards long-term, systemic collaborations, strengthened by ESG–CSR convergence and transparent sustainability disclosures.<br></li>



<li><strong>Digital CSR</strong> – Leveraging e-learning, telehealth and digital skilling to expand reach and inclusion.<br></li>



<li><strong>Geographic expansion</strong> – Extending CSR initiatives into Tier 2/3 cities and rural communities for deeper social development.<br></li>



<li><strong>Thematic priorities</strong> – Health, women’s empowerment, STEM education, scholarships for girls and skill development as focus areas.<br></li>



<li><strong>Employee volunteering</strong> – Embedding purpose and ownership within corporate culture, amplifying community impact.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a quiet classroom in Odisha, a girl named Shalini stood up to answer a question. She had no idea her life was about to change. A red stain on her seat, a marker of her first period, brought giggles, whispers, and then silence. No one had told her what menstruation was. She thought she was ill. The next day, overwhelmed by shame, she begged her parents not to send her back to school. And just like that, the promise of a brighter future began to fade.</p>



<p>Shalini’s story is not unique. Across rural India, girls face a combination of stigma, silence, and inaccessibility when it comes to managing their periods. Without awareness, proper facilities, or access to sanitary products, many are pushed out of classrooms, losing days of learning and, eventually, the opportunity for a better future.</p>

<p><strong>UNICEF &amp; WATERAID INDIA STUDY (2015)*</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-unspoken-numbers"><strong>The unspoken numbers</strong></h2>



<p>According to UNICEF India, over 253 million adolescents live in India, with nearly half being girls and 25% of them in rural areas. Despite several government-led menstrual hygiene initiatives, thousands of girls still drop out of school due to shame, pain, poor access to products, and lack of supportive infrastructure.</p>



<p>A qualitative study in six Delhi government schools found that around <a href="https://jointactionforwater.org/a-study-of-school-absenteeism-during-menstruation-amongst-adolescent-girls-in-india/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">40% of girls missed school</a> during menstruation owing to menstrual pain, fear of staining, and restrictive social norms.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-period-absenteeism-why">Period absenteeism-why?</h3>



<p>Whether in rural villages or urban neighbourhoods, a girl’s first period often arrives unannounced and with fear. Her body undergoes unfamiliar changes, but in the absence of support and information, this moment becomes isolating. When compounded by poor infrastructure, stigma, and silence, menstruation becomes not just a personal struggle, but an educational barrier.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Social taboos&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Even today, in many parts of India, menstruating girls and women are subjected to regressive restrictions like being barred from entering temples, kitchens, or even touching food on the grounds of being “impure.” These practices are reinforced by harmful myths, such as the belief that menstrual blood is toxic or that using sanitary pads causes infertility. As a result, many girls are pushed toward using cloth or other unhygienic alternatives compromising their <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2606" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a>, dignity, and confidence.</p>



<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Poor menstrual product access</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>In many rural communities, girls face limited access to safe menstrual products, clean cloth. or private drying spaces. Adding to their troubles is the issue of no proper disposal facilities; they often resort to using ashes or rags as quiet acts of desperation that compromise their health and dignity.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Menstrual hygiene in Indian women (15-24yrs)</strong></p>



<p>Recent data reflects encouraging progress: 78% of women in India now use hygienic menstrual methods such as sanitary napkins, tampons, or menstrual cups indicating growing awareness and improved access. However, among adolescent girls, only 42% rely exclusively on these hygienic practices*, with significant disparities persisting across states and districts. This gap underscores the urgent need for targeted interventions that address both availability and cultural barriers in underserved regions.</p>

<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Paying the hidden cost of secrecy and infrastructure gaps</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Many girls across rural India navigate their periods in secrecy by hiding pads in books, fearing stains, missing school events, and sometimes their yearly reviews as well because of menstruation. With no dustbins, running water, or private toilets in schools, managing menstrual hygiene becomes near impossible. The result is a deafening mix of isolation, shame, and lost days of learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Menstrual health is a national priority</strong></p>



<p>India has taken steps in the right direction. The Menstrual Hygiene Scheme (MHS), by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, offers subsidised sanitary napkins and peer counselling through ASHA workers. The Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK) promotes adolescent health, including menstrual awareness. The Suvidha Scheme by the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilisers introduced biodegradable sanitary pads at ₹1, increasing affordability.</p>



<p>Yet gaps persist. Many of these programmes struggle to reach India’s most marginalised girls. Product availability doesn’t always translate to product use, especially when surrounded by silence and stigma.</p>



<p>As a result, many adolescent girls navigate menstruation in isolation—confused, unprepared, and unsupported. For countless girls, this social conditioning leads to school absenteeism, diminishing their confidence, academic continuity, and long-term opportunities.</p>



<p><strong>Addressing the gaps through strategic partnerships&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>To bridge these challenges, strategic CSR–NGO partnerships are serving as catalytic agents. By combining grassroots reach with corporate scale, these collaborations have the potential to advance menstrual hygiene management as a systemic solution driving health equity, school retention, and long-term social impact for adolescent girls across India.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-improving-school-infrastructure-beyond-brick-and-mortar"><strong>Improving school infrastructure beyond brick and mortar</strong></h3>



<p>One major challenge for school girls from rural communities during menstruation is the lack of functional school infrastructure; poor washrooms, inadequate disposal, limited water, and no privacy often lead to school dropouts.</p>



<p><strong>What can be done</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Support the development of gender sensitive washrooms with lockable doors, running water, disposable bins and incinerators.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>By partnering with NGOs, corporates can implement their CSR goals for women empowerment. Through impact dashboards, the projects can be tracked to identify the usage, maintenance, and overall the hygienic parameters required for young girls in home and schools.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-culture-stigma-needs-community-solutions-nbsp"><strong>Culture stigma needs community solutions&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>One of the most important issues that must be addressed immediately at a large scale is the lack of awareness about <strong>menstrual health </strong>amongst young girls and their communities. This becomes more concerning when the concerns of young girls are silenced due to vulture silence, shame, and myths that often lead to fear, poor hygiene, and isolation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What can be done</strong></p>



<p>Corporates can support community based menstrual literacy programmes where they can collaborate with local organisations, ASHA workers and peer educators to increase awareness on menstrual hygiene. Furthermore, they can also educate the girls, teachers and community workers through culturally adapted IEC tools (flipbooks, comics, digital stories ) to challenge taboos and normalise conversations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take the example of <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/smilescapes-august-2024/in-focus-3/#:~:text=A%20case%20in%20point%20here,developed%20a%20health%2Dseeking%20behavior." data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Shivani</a>. Once hesitant and withdrawn, she found her footing through menstrual health sessions conducted by Smile Foundation’s <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/women-empowerment/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Swabhiman</a> programme. With accurate information and support, she gained not only knowledge, but also the confidence to speak up. Today, she serves as a peer educator empowering other adolescent girls in her community and promoting health-seeking behaviour.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of its integrated approach to women’s health, Smile Foundation’s Swabhiman trains <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/workshops-events/27-swabhiman-volunteers-trained-on-reproductive-and-menstrual-health-2/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">community-based volunteers</a> as reproductive and menstrual health educators in underserved areas. This capacity-building intervention strategically addresses knowledge gaps, dismantles cultural taboos, and promotes safe menstrual hygiene practices directly reducing school absenteeism and health risks among adolescent girls. By embedding peer-led advocacy into last-mile delivery, the initiative strengthens behavioural change at the community level while aligning with national adolescent health goals and SDG targets.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-making-innovation-accessible-affordable-and-adaptable-nbsp"><strong>Making innovation accessible, affordable, and adaptable&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>As key drivers of social impact, CSR–NGO partnerships are well positioned to eliminate unhygienic menstrual practices such as the use of cloth, ash, or sacks by co-developing and scaling access to affordable sanitary products tailored for rural adolescent girls. In light of growing environmental concerns, these partnerships must also prioritise innovation in biodegradable and reusable menstrual solutions, ensuring both adolescent health and ecological sustainability. Such an approach aligns with ESG goals and supports long-term, community-based health equity.</p>



<p><strong>What can be done</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Support women-led production units for biodegradable sanitary napkins or menstrual cups.</li>



<li>Collaborate on last mile distribution through workshops in local communities and schools, <em>Anganwadis </em>and frontline health workers.</li>
</ul>



<p>For instance, through targeted <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/workshops-events/workshop-on-menstrual-hygiene-to-spread-awareness-on-safe-menstrual-practices-2/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">workshops on menstrual hygiene</a>, Smile Foundation’s Swabhiman programme ensures last-mile delivery of accurate, stigma-free education to adolescent girls in underserved communities. By promoting body literacy and safe hygiene practices, the initiative empowers girls with the confidence to stay in school, safeguard their health, and become agents of change in their communities.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Support impact evaluations to track product adoption, usage frequency, and behavioural shifts.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>In today’s socially aware landscape, people expect more from businesses than just products or profits. They look for purpose, compassion, and accountability. Cause Related Marketing (CRM) is emerging as a compelling answer to this call, where brands actively support social causes while meaningfully engaging consumers. It’s more than a marketing strategy; it’s a reflection of the values a brand stands for.</p>

<p>CRM allows businesses to align profit with purpose, resulting in deeper consumer trust, stronger loyalty, and measurable community impact. As we look around the world and within India we see the growing impact of such partnerships, not just on balance sheets but on lives.</p>

<h3 id="h-the-global-shift-towards-purpose-driven-marketing" class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Global Shift Towards Purpose-Driven Marketing</strong></h3>

<p>A growing body of research confirms what we see in practice: people want brands to lead with purpose. According to the <a href="https://www.edelman.com/sites/g/files/aatuss191/files/2023-03/2023%20Edelman%20Trust%20Barometer%20Global%20Report%20FINAL.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Edelman Trust Barometer 2023</a>, 75% of Indian consumers believe companies should take an active role in addressing societal challenges. This mirrors a wider global movement where brands are evolving from transactional to transformational.</p>

<p>At home, leading campaigns of cause related marketing in India such as <em>Tata’s Jago Re and Hindustan Unilever’s Swachh Aadat, Swachh Bharat </em>are excellent examples of how iconic brands are embedding purpose into their DNA demonstrating that social responsibility is not a side effort, but a core business imperative.</p>

<h3 id="h-why-cause-related-marketing-works" class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Cause Related Marketing Works</strong></h3>

<p>India, with its complex social challenges and vast economic disparities, provides fertile ground for brands to create meaningful social impact. A Nielsen report suggests that <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/insights/2018/what-sustainability-means-today/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">73% of Indian consumers </a>are willing to pay more for products and services from companies that are committed to the public good.</p>

<p><strong><em>Is Cause Related Marketing a powerful proposition for businesses?</em></strong></p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Enhanced Brand Reputation and Trust</strong><strong><br /></strong> Supporting real causes helps build authenticity. Consumers are more inclined to trust brands that act on their values, beyond just campaigns and slogans.</li>

<li><strong>Stronger Customer Loyalty</strong><strong><br /></strong> When consumers see a brand taking real action to uplift society, they form emotional connections making them more likely to stay loyal.</li>

<li><strong>Competitive Advantage in a Saturated Market</strong><strong><br /></strong> Purpose-driven branding stands out. It speaks to conscious consumers, future-focused investors, and talent who want to work where their values are mirrored.</li>

<li><strong>Higher Employee Engagement and Retention</strong><strong><br /></strong> Working for a cause-oriented brand makes employees feel part of something larger than themselves, fostering pride, productivity, and long-term retention.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Embedding CRM into CSR: The Smile Foundation Approach</strong></p>

<p>Cause Related Marketing becomes most effective when integrated into a company&#8217;s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy. This synergy transforms social investment into lasting stakeholder value.</p>

<p>Smile Foundation, one of India’s most trusted NGOs, offers a structured platform to make this possible. With proven impact in <a class="wpil_keyword_link" title="Education" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2489" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a>, healthcare, livelihoods, and women’s empowerment, Smile Foundation helps businesses co-create campaigns that resonate with customers and deliver tangible change in underserved communities.</p>

<h3 id="h-1-telling-real-stories-from-real-lives" class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Telling Real Stories from Real Lives</strong></h3>

<p>At the heart of any CRM initiative lies authentic storytelling. With Smile Foundation’s grassroots presence, brands can build emotionally compelling campaigns that reflect lived realities from young girls accessing education for the first time, to mothers receiving timely healthcare in remote areas.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>For example, the<a href="https://zouk.co.in/collections/power-potli?srsltid=AfmBOop8U8DhMJCwF5XWNhfLOtT4JnM6ZJ-DdAydt9r7N-ZPTb8q_Ama" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> <em>Powerपोटली</em></a>—a thoughtful keychain product supporting girls’ education under the <em>She Can Fly</em> initiative. Every purchase funds access to learning, nutrition, and healthcare for girls. This simple yet powerful gesture enables consumers to turn everyday choices into acts of compassion.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="h-2-fostering-long-term-high-impact-partnerships" class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Fostering Long-Term, High-Impact Partnerships</strong></h3>

<p>CRM isn’t about one-time donations. It’s about long-term commitment to a shared cause. Smile Foundation invites corporates to build thematic, multi-year collaborations that allow campaigns to scale, evolve, and make deeper impact.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>For instance, <em>a l</em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJoGWOIT0dt/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><em>eading digital payments platform</em></a> has joined hands with Smile Foundation’s education initiative to ensure continued learning for children in underserved regions. Such partnerships help bridge critical resource gaps, ensuring every child gets a fair shot at a better future.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="h-3-ensuring-transparency-and-measurable-results" class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Ensuring Transparency and Measurable Results</strong></h3>

<p>Consumer trust is rooted in transparency. Smile Foundation’s robust Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) framework ensures that every rupee, every effort, is accounted for with clear metrics and documented outcomes.</p>

<p>One such example includes a recent partnership with <em>a</em><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/smilescapes-february-2025/partnerships/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow"><em> global law </em></a><em>firm</em> during the Manali disaster relief initiative. Together, they upgraded Primary Healthcare Centres to provide timely care for affected communities demonstrating accountability through measurable, long-term impact.</p>

<p>.</p>

<h3 id="h-partner-with-purpose" class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Partner with Purpose</strong></h3>

<p>In a world where customers are seeking more meaningful connections with brands, Cause-Related Marketing is no longer optional-it’s essential. When integrated into your CSR strategy, CRM becomes a dynamic tool for both impact and growth.</p>

<p>With Smile Foundation’s credibility, reach, and development expertise, corporates can build campaigns that speak to the heart while driving measurable change. Whether your focus is education, <a class="wpil_keyword_link" title="Health" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2490" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a>, or women’s empowerment, there’s a shared purpose waiting to be fulfilled. <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/cause-related-marketing/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Connect with us to learn more</a>—and let’s build a future where business success and social good go hand in hand.</p>

<p>In today&#8217;s dynamic business and social landscape, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is no longer a goodwill gesture, it&#8217;s a strategic imperative. As economies evolve and inequalities persist, CSR partnership is becoming a powerful tool to shape the social fabric through technical development, economic inclusion, and sustainable growth. The collaboration between businesses, civil society organisations and the government can unlock shared value, driving systemic change while strengthening long-term business viability.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-csr-partnership-that-builds-societies"><strong>CSR Partnership That Builds Societies</strong></h2>



<p>Corporate Social Responsibility refers to a business model where companies integrate social and environmental concerns in their operations and stakeholder interactions. CSR goes beyond philanthropy; it reflects<em> accountability to communities, the environment, and society at large</em>. </p>



<p>At its best, CSR is about creating <em>inclusive value</em>, <em>supporting local economies</em>, and<em> strengthening institutions</em> that enable societal progress. </p>



<p><strong><em>A powerful example of CSR partnership</em> in action</strong> is the collaboration between Smile Foundation and an industry leader in the paint industry &#8211; the<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C7IrF6cMLTQ/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> &#8216;iTrain on Wheels&#8217; initiative</a>, launched in 2021, brings mobile skill development training to blue-collar workers, especially painters, across 24 states. Beyond enhancing<em> technical capabilities</em>, the programme includes<em> modules on communication and entrepreneurial skills</em> uplifting participants not just as skilled labourers but as micro-entrepreneurs and community leaders.</p>



<p>Women like <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/upskilling-painters-of-india-for-better-quality-of-life/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Sakhiat Pala Laloo, Amrutben, and Bhanuben </a>have leveraged the training to overcome personal and societal challenges, emerging as professionals and mentors within their communities. These stories underscore <em>CSR’s <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/impact-investment-transforming-indias-social-landscape/" title="Impact Investment Transforming India’s Social Landscape" data-wpil-monitor-id="2484" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">transformative potentia</em>l when <em>businesses invest</a> in human capital</em>, communities thrive.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-corporate-philanthropy-vs-corporate-social-responsibility"><strong>Corporate Philanthropy vs Corporate Social Responsibility</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;A meaningful distinction exists between corporate philanthropy and corporate social responsibility. Philanthropy often manifests as one-time charitable donations without long-term engagement. In contrast, CSR is strategic and sustained, embedding societal impact into core business practices. According to the<a href="https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/religion-and-philosophy/corporate-social-responsibility-sociology" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> EBSCO article</a> &#8220;Corporate Philanthropy vs. Corporate Social Responsibility,&#8221; while both aim to address social issues, CSR delivers a more holistic, measurable, and long-lasting impact by aligning business operations with social objectives.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td><strong>ASPECT</strong></td><td><strong>CORPORATE PHILANTHROPY</strong></td><td><strong>CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Nature</td><td>One- time Charitable donation</td><td>Strategic and Sustained</td></tr><tr><td>Engagement level</td><td>Minimal Long Term Involvement</td><td>Embedded in business operations</td></tr><tr><td>Goal</td><td>Altruistic Giving</td><td>Aligning business with social objectives</td></tr><tr><td>Impact</td><td>Limited and Short term</td><td>Holistic, Measurable and Long lasting</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><strong>CSR with The Triple Bottom Line: People, Planet, and Profit</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The triple bottom line (TBL) approach urges businesses to balance social and environmental responsibilities with financial performance. This framework doesn&#8217;t just enhance a company&#8217;s moral standing it drives tangible business outcomes:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Improved corporate culture</strong>: Companies focused on TBL see stronger employee engagement, retention, and workplace diversity.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Customer loyalty</strong>: Ethical performance influences consumer choices. Purpose-driven brands inspire trust and foster loyalty.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Business performance</strong>: TBL-focused businesses often outperform competitors by investing in long-term value.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Regulatory resilience</strong>: TBL practices help companies avoid penalties and reputational risks related to ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) failures.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Investor appeal</strong>: Transparent ESG reporting is now a critical factor for attracting responsible investment.</li>
</ul>



<p>Major corporations like<strong> </strong>Apple, GE, and Procter &amp; Gamble have adopted the triple bottom line, proving that aligning social good with profitability is not only feasible but beneficial.</p>

<p>India’s healthcare sector is evolving rapidly, driven by strategic investments, increasing biopharma funding, and dynamic cross-industry collaborations. In 2024 alone, the industry witnessed a 24% rise in funding, with 2025 set to surpass expectations. The country remains a <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/04/india-healthcare-ai-innovation/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">global leader in generics and biosimilars</a>, while AI-powered partnerships between technology and pharmaceutical companies are transforming diagnostics and data-led care. Yet, a vital question remains: <strong>are these innovations truly reaching India’s rural healthcare system? </strong>Public-private partnerships and mobile medical units could hold the key to delivering equitable, technology-enabled care to underserved communities.</p>

<p>This testimonial underscores the multifaceted challenges of India’s rural healthcare system. Building an inclusive rural healthcare ecosystem in India is vital to ensuring equitable access to medical services for all. Initiatives that deliver compassionate, doorstep healthcare solutions like<strong> Mobile Medical Units </strong>can play a crucial role in<a href="https://journals.lww.com/ijcm/fulltext/2018/43030/Challenges_to_Healthcare_in_India___The_Five_A_s.1.aspx" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> bridging systemic gaps</a>—particularly for underserved communities.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Infrastructure Deficit Hindering Equitable Access to Care<br></strong> Despite national advancements, rural healthcare infrastructure remains significantly underdeveloped, with inadequate facilities, outdated equipment, and poor connectivity. This disparity perpetuates unequal access to quality medical services and delays timely intervention in vulnerable communities.<br></li>



<li><strong>Severe Shortage of Trained Medical Professionals in Rural Regions</strong><strong><br></strong> A persistent dearth of qualified doctors, nurses, and specialists in rural areas severely undermines the continuity and quality of care. Overburdened and under-supported, frontline health workers struggle to meet the needs of dispersed populations, affecting outcomes at scale.<br></li>



<li><strong>Healthcare Access Disrupted by <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" title="Livelihood" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="610" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Livelihood</a> Dependency and Geographic Barriers</strong><strong><br></strong> Many rural residents face a distressing trade-off: travel long distances for medical attention or lose crucial daily wages. The absence of proximal, functional healthcare centres forces patients to defer treatment, often until emergencies arise.<br></li>



<li><strong>The Economic Toll of Illness: Families Forced into Debt for Basic Treatment</strong><strong><br></strong> With limited affordable care options locally, families are frequently compelled to sell land or incur high-interest loans to access treatment in urban centres. This financial burden deepens rural poverty, making healthcare a source of long-term socioeconomic distress.</li>
</ul>



<p>However, to sustain and scale such impact, the persistent challenges of infrastructure, accessibility, and affordability must be addressed collectively. <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" title="Corporate Partnerships" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="367" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Corporate Social Responsibility</a> (CSR) has a pivotal role to play in this transformation<em>.</em> By aligning business responsibility with community health needs, corporations can help strengthen rural healthcare delivery, making quality care not a privilege, but a fundamental right for every citizen, regardless of geography or income.</p>

<p>India’s healthcare landscape has been significantly transformed by key government health initiatives such as &#8211;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Ayushman Bharat and the National Health Mission (comprising NRHM and NUHM) are key public health initiatives in India.</li>



<li>A strong focus is placed on Reproductive-Maternal-Neonatal-Child-Adolescent Health (RMNCH+A) to address critical life stages.</li>



<li>These programmes have significantly expanded healthcare access in underserved and remote regions.</li>



<li>They address both communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCDs).</li>



<li>The approach emphasises not only treatment but also preventive care and the promotion of community wellbeing.</li>
</ul>



<p>Despite this progress, accessibility to healthcare services remains uneven across rural geographies. While government-backed initiatives lay the foundational framework, there is an urgent need for delivery mechanisms that can bridge the last-mile gap. This is where <em>Mobile Medical Units (MMUs), supported through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) investments, have become a critical enabler.</em></p>



<p><strong>CSR-backed MMUs</strong> serve as a lifeline for communities often left out of mainstream healthcare delivery. They bring:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>&nbsp;Medical diagnostics and treatment directly to village doorsteps.</li>



<li>&nbsp;Act as catalysts for promoting healthy habits and preventive awareness—amplifying the impact of government programmes on the ground.</li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;In essence, they operationalise<strong> the “3 As” of effective healthcare delivery</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Affordability</strong></li>



<li><strong>Accessibility</strong></li>



<li><strong>Awareness</strong></li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Strategic Benefit</strong></td><td><strong>Implementation</strong></td><td><strong>Impact</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Extending Lifespan in Underserved Areas<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Reducing Treatment Complications through Early Access<br><br><br><br>Lowering Financial Burden for Rural Families<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Saving Lives through Timely Screening and Diagnosis</td><td>Mobile Medical Units enable early detection and management of diseases, especially Non communicable diseases, directly within remote communities—improving long-term health outcomes and life expectancy.<br><br>Immediate access to basic healthcare reduces delays, preventing escalation of treatable conditions.

<p>The integration of Mobile Medical Units into India’s broader healthcare strategy represents a convergence of public intent and private capability. Corporates, through targeted CSR investments, have the opportunity to supplement public health infrastructure by extending their reach, scaling impact, and ensuring that the promise of equitable healthcare is not limited by geography. Moreover, such initiatives humanise corporate action, translating boardroom decisions into real, tangible outcomes in the lives of vulnerable populations.</p>

<p>India’s remarkable strides in maternal care and infant health paint a hopeful picture. The <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2112476" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Maternal</a><a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2112476" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"> </a><a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2112476" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Mortality Ratio</a> (MMR) has fallen from 130 to 97 per 100,000 live births. Neonatal and infant mortality rates have also dropped significantly—by 65% and 69% respectively—surpassing global averages. Yet behind these promising statistics lies a sobering reality of India&#8217;s rural maternal care system.</p>



<p>Each number represents a mother—often rural, frequently impoverished, and too often unheard. Her journey through pregnancy and childbirth is far more than a biological event.  Such scenarios reflect that we are going through a test of strength of our maternal care system in rural India, the equity of our social structures, and the depth of our collective compassion, and we have a long way to go.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rituals of care – More than cultural symbols</strong></h2>



<p>In rural India, baby showers, known by various names like <em>Godh Bharai, Seemantham, Shaad, or Dohale Jevan</em>, are threads in a communal safety net. These traditions embody emotional, spiritual, and nutritional support for the expectant mother.</p>



<p>In North India’s <em>Godh Bharai</em>, blessings, music, and festive meals offer joy and reassurance. South India’s <em>Seemantham</em> celebrates the mother with bangles believed to emit vibrations that calm the unborn child. In Eastern and Western regions, food, music, and community love are central to ceremonies like <em>Shaad</em> and <em>Dohale Jevan</em>.</p>



<p>Beyond their spiritual richness, these events reduce maternal stress, reinforce support networks, and provide emotional grounding—essentials for a safe pregnancy. The shared wisdom from older women, nourishing foods, and joyful celebrations help prepare her mentally and physically for childbirth and motherhood. Such ceremonies also mark a shift in the mother’s role, affirming her importance and care within the family. </p>



<p>This emotional reassurance, combined with social and nutritional support, contributes to better maternal <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1453" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> and can positively impact the baby’s development. In essence, these age-old customs are deeply rooted systems of community care that foster resilience, wellbeing, and healthy beginnings.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The gaps in rural maternal healthcare</strong></h3>



<p>India’s efforts to improve maternal health have yielded significant progress. Since 1990, the country has witnessed an <a href="https://mohfw.gov.in/?q=pressreleasetb-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">83% decline in its Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)</a>, a testament to national policy interventions and improved service delivery under frameworks like the National Health Mission. However, behind these promising statistics lies a more complex and uneven reality—particularly in rural India.</p>



<p>Critical complications such as excessive bleeding (postpartum haemorrhage), sepsis, pregnancy-induced hypertension, obstructed labour, and unsafe abortions continue to claim the lives of countless women, especially those in underserved regions. The persistence of these largely preventable causes underscores that while healthcare systems have expanded, their reach, reliability, and equity remain insufficient.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Awareness: What she doesn’t know can hurt her</strong></h3>



<p>Lack of awareness remains a major barrier to accessing maternal healthcare in India. Many women are unaware of the importance of antenatal check-ups (ANC), resulting in missed opportunities for early detection of complications. Among currently pregnant women, only 30% had three or more ANC visits, while 27% had none. Even among lactating women, 18% reported zero ANC visits. In Punjab, NFHS-4 data shows just 67.8% of women received four ANC visits. These figures underline the urgent need for targeted awareness campaigns to promote consistent, informed engagement with maternal and child health services.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Affordability: Confronting the cost of survival</strong></h3>



<p>For many rural families, maternal health is a financial compromise. The inability to afford nutritious food, travel for medical check-ups, or private consultations leads to delayed care and preventable complications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore<strong>, </strong>women delay antenatal check-ups or give birth at home, not by choice—but because they simply cannot afford the journey to a clinic, the tests, or even a nutritious meal. With no financial cushion, families often choose between food and healthcare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The absence of affordable iron supplements, fresh vegetables, or hygiene essentials leaves mothers dangerously malnourished and anemic. The result is a cycle of poor maternal outcomes passed down across generations because health becomes a luxury only few can buy.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Accessibility: When care is far, risks grow near</strong></h3>



<p>In rural India, many expectant mothers face the harsh reality of travelling several kilometres—often on unpaved roads or via scarce public transport—to access even basic healthcare. These delays can prove fatal, especially during labour or pregnancy-related emergencies. The absence of reliable transport systems and referral mechanisms further compounds the risk. Sub-centres and primary health centres, intended as frontline providers of maternal care, are frequently understaffed, under-equipped, or entirely non-existent. Without skilled birth attendants and timely access to essential medicines and diagnostic tools, treatable complications like haemorrhage, eclampsia, and infections become deadly. The distance to care becomes a life-threatening gap.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Availability: Geography and broken systems block the path to care</strong></h3>



<p>A mother in a remote village may walk miles for a blood pressure check, or worse, never go at all. Healthcare is often distant and sporadic, with clinics understaffed or unreachable. Mobile medical vans are rare, and even when available, they may not return soon enough. Anganwadi workers, often the only hope for health <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2457" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a>, are stretched thin.</p>



<p>The lack of timely screenings or follow-ups can turn a manageable condition into a fatal one. For these women, distance and delay can be the difference between life and death.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Intersecting Inequities</strong></h3>



<p>These three barriers do not operate in isolation. Rather, their intersection deepens existing socio-economic divides. Data consistently shows that <a href="https://www.prb.org/resources/maternal-care-in-india-reveals-gaps-between-urban-and-rural-rich-and-poor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">utilisation of maternal healthcare services</a>—both antenatal and postnatal—varies sharply based on income, caste, education, and geography. Women from lower-income or marginalised communities are significantly less likely to receive skilled care during childbirth, contributing to disproportionate maternal health outcomes.</p>



<p>Moreover, the absence of skilled healthcare workers at the time of delivery remains a persistent challenge. Without trained personnel to guide safe births and manage complications, the goal of ensuring every mother a safe pregnancy remains unmet in large parts of the country. In sum, the journey towards maternal health equity in rural India requires more than infrastructure—it demands a transformation of systems, mindsets, and investments that address the <strong>availability, accessibility, and affordability</strong> of care for every woman.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Community care in action with Swabhiman</strong></h2>



<p>Our initiatives directly involve pregnant women, lactating mothers, caregivers, and children through awareness, counselling, and interactive sessions. We aim at driving behavioral change around nutrition and health practices for women within her community. In the financial year of  2024, <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/women-empowerment/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Swabhiman</a></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Reached <strong>190,000+ women</strong> across 6 states</li>



<li>Sensitised <strong>76,000+ women</strong> on reproductive and child health</li>



<li>Provided healthcare to <strong>72,000+ women and children</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Stakeholder &amp; community engagements</strong></h3>



<p>Sustainable change in maternal and child health initiatives begins with effective collaboration among key stakeholders. Regular interface meetings are held with Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI) members, government officials, and representatives from various sectors such as education, health, and local governance.</p>



<p><strong>Key Initiatives and Community Involvement</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Community Kitchen Gardens:<br></strong>To improve nutritional intake, 22 community kitchen gardens were established, providing beneficiaries with locally grown vegetables such as bottle gourd, tomatoes, and pumpkins.<br></li>



<li><strong>Observing Special Days:<br></strong>Key health and nutrition-related days such as Women’s Day, Breastfeeding Week ,and POSHAN MAH  were observed with awareness campaigns, screening camps, recipe competitions, and educational sessions. These events aimed to educate women and caregivers on proper nutrition and maternal care practices.<br></li>



<li><strong>Breastfeeding Awareness Week:<br></strong>In partnership with ICDS and the PepsiCo Foundation, Smile Foundation organised breastfeeding demonstrations, emphasising the benefits of proper attachment and positioning. Awareness sessions educated caregivers on the importance of breastfeeding for both mother and child.<br></li>



<li><strong>Godh bharai and Annaprashan Diwas:<br></strong>Monthly events focused on maternal and child nutrition included Godh bharai for pregnant women, offering nutritional support and education, and Annaprashan for children starting complementary feeding. These celebrations provide vital community support and promote behaviour change in nutrition practices.<br></li>



<li><strong>POSHAN MAH Celebrations:<br></strong>Smile Foundation, along with ICDS and Education departments, organised nutrition recipe competitions, school-level activities, and kitchen garden initiatives during POSHAN MAH, enhancing community involvement and nutrition awareness.</li>
</ol>



<p>Through these initiatives, stakeholder collaboration and community participation continue to drive positive outcomes in maternal and child health.</p>



<p><strong>Nutrition is grown, served, and shared</strong></p>



<p>Nutrition and maternal care are not just delivered — they are cultivated, practised, and celebrated within the community. Nutrition is grown in kitchen gardens, served through local recipes, and shared via counselling, health camps, and regular screenings — ensuring year-round wellbeing for mothers and children.</p>



<p><strong>Growing nutrition inside homes</strong></p>



<p>132 kitchen gardens were set up at Anganwadi centres and homes, including 3 community gardens, using distributed winter vegetable seeds. This ensured access to fresh produce for daily use and nutrition events. The Education Department expanded the model to 21 schools through district and NRLM support.</p>



<p><strong>Learning through recipes<br></strong>Inter-village recipe contests engaged 151 women and caregivers, showcasing healthy, affordable dishes using local ingredients. Judged by officials, the contests promoted practical nutrition and honoured winners at the district level.</p>



<p><strong>Counselling and Follow-Up<br></strong>Regular follow-ups were conducted for anaemic and malnourished women, with ASHAs, Anganwadi workers, and community staff offering focused counselling and timely referrals to strengthen maternal health outcomes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>PARTNER FOR COMMUNITY-LED TRANSFORMATION</strong></h3>



<p>Maternal care in India is at a pivotal moment. While national data reflects progress, the ground reality in rural areas demands deeper, more inclusive interventions. It is not merely about improving statistics but transforming lives.</p>



<p>The Swabhiman programme offers a blueprint for community-led, sustainable maternal health solutions. Its success is rooted in collective action—from mothers and caregivers to local officials and frontline workers.</p>



<p>CSR partnerships have the potential to amplify this impact manifold. By aligning business resources with community health goals, companies can co-create meaningful change—ensuring a robust maternal care in across India, including the remotest corners because every mother receives the care, dignity, and support she deserves.</p>



<p>This Mother&#8217;s Day,<a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"> partner to scale community reach</a>. Let’s make care meet for rural mothers of India.</p>

<p>A world increasingly characterized by socio-economic disparities have reasons for the seeds of empathy and social responsibility must be sown early. The Smile Foundation&#8217;s <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/child-for-child/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Child for Child (CFC) programme</a> in India exemplifies how engaging children from privileged backgrounds can foster a more equitable society. By sensitizing young minds to the challenges faced by their less fortunate peers, CFC not only nurtures empathy but also lays the groundwork for a more inclusive future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The science of empathy in children: A developmental perspective</strong></h2>



<p>Empathy, the ability to understand and share the feelings of others, is a critical component of social and emotional development. Research published in the ScienceDirect journal indicates that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885201424000248" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">empathic concern</a> begins to emerge in the second year of life, suggesting that early interventions can have a profound impact on a child&#8217;s capacity for empathy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Children learn empathy through meaningful relationships and observing empathetic behavior in adults. By modeling kindness and providing opportunities for cooperative play, caregivers and educators can <a href="https://illinoisearlylearning.org/tipsheets/kidscare/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">nurture empathy from a young age</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bridging socio-economic divides through early engagement</strong> <strong>and empathy in children</strong></h2>



<p>Launched in 2006, the CFC programme’s core objective is to instill a sense of social responsibility among privileged children by exposing them to the realities of low-income communities. Through interactive sessions, workshops, and storytelling, CFC encourages children to reflect on their own privileges and understand the importance of contributing to societal well-being.</p>



<p>This approach aligns with findings which emphasize the role of early experiences in developing empathy. Children who engage in cooperative activities and observe empathetic behavior are more likely to exhibit caring behaviors themselves. By providing opportunities for privileged children to interact with and understand the lives of their underprivileged peers, CFC fosters a generation that values compassion and inclusivity.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The &#8220;Child for Child&#8221; Initiative: A Three-Pronged Approach</strong></h3>



<p>The CFC programme operates on a comprehensive model targeting three key stakeholders:​</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Children</strong>: Through interactive sessions and workshops, children are introduced to concepts of empathy, social justice, and community engagement. These sessions often include storytelling, role-playing, and discussions on real-life scenarios to foster emotional intelligence.​</li>



<li><strong>Educators</strong>: Teachers are provided with training and resources to facilitate conversations around empathy and inclusivity in the classroom. Workshops focus on integrating value-based <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2455" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> into existing curricula, aligning with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020&#8217;s emphasis on holistic development.</li>



<li><strong>Parents and Caregivers</strong>: Recognizing the pivotal role of families in shaping children&#8217;s values, the programme engages parents through webinars and communication tools, encouraging them to reinforce empathetic behaviors at home.​</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>Impact and Reach: Quantitative and Qualitative Outcomes</strong></p>



<p>Since its inception, the CFC programme has made significant strides:​</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Engagement</strong>: Over 3,00,000 children have participated in the programme across 1,500+ schools nationwide.​</li>



<li><strong>Value Education Sessions</strong>: More than 2,500 sessions have been conducted, focusing on ethical values and social awareness.​</li>



<li><strong>SIFFCY</strong>: The Smile International Film Festival for Children and Youth (SIFFCY), an extension of the CFC initiative, has showcased over 100 critically acclaimed films to more than 5,000 students, promoting discussions on global issues and moral dilemmas.​</li>
</ul>



<p>Qualitative assessments of the children indicate a positive shift in students&#8217; attitudes, with increased participation in community service and a heightened sense of social responsibility.​</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Policy implications and the role of social-emotional learning</strong></h3>



<p>The success of programmes like CFC underscores the importance of integrating social-emotional learning (SEL) into educational curricula. SEL not only enhances academic performance but also equips students with the skills necessary to navigate complex social environments. According to a meta-analysis published in <em>Child Development</em>, SEL interventions are associated with an 11-percentile-point gain in academic achievement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, SEL programmes have been linked to reductions in aggression and improvements in social behavior, making them a valuable tool in promoting a more harmonious society. By incorporating SEL into national education policies, governments can foster a generation of empathetic, socially responsible citizens.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cross-sector collaboration: A blueprint for sustainable change</strong></h3>



<p>The CFC programme&#8217;s success is not solely attributable to its curriculum but also to its collaborative approach. By partnering with schools, educators, and parents, Smile Foundation ensures that the message of empathy permeates every aspect of a child&#8217;s environment. This holistic strategy aligns with the role of caregivers and educators in modeling empathetic behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, the programme&#8217;s engagement with partners for funding and resource support exemplifies the potential of cross-sector collaboration in driving social change. By leveraging the strengths of various stakeholders, CFC creates a sustainable model for fostering empathy and social responsibility among children.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cultivating a compassionate future</strong></h3>



<p>The current times marked by increasing polarization and inequality needs programmes like the Child for Child programme that instills empathy and social consciousness in children from a young age. This way we can cultivate a more compassionate and equitable society. The integration of SEL into educational policies, coupled with collaborative efforts across sectors, can amplify the impact of such programmes.</p>



<p>As we look to the future, it is imperative that we invest in the emotional and social development of our children. By doing so, we not only enrich their lives but also lay the foundation for a more just and empathetic world.</p>

<p>The Indian Premier League (IPL) is both a sporting spectacle and a cultural phenomenon that unites and inspires millions. For children, IPL is not merely a source of entertainment—it embodies lessons in resilience, sportsmanship, and determination. In India, cricket ignites unparalleled passion in almost all of us. This enthusiasm is felt even in the most remote corners of the country, where raw talent thrives. With the proper nurturing and organized growth, these budding talents can go a long way in affirming cricket as the engine of national advancement. As IPL 2025 introduces another year of excitement</p>



<p>As IPL 2025 brings another season of thrill, it&#8217;s&nbsp;imperative&nbsp;to&nbsp;consider&nbsp;how this league can&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;driving&nbsp;force&nbsp;for rural child development and&nbsp;emphasize&nbsp;the&nbsp;contributions&nbsp;of NGOs in India&nbsp;striving&nbsp;day&nbsp;and night&nbsp;to bridge the gap in extracurricular&nbsp;activities&nbsp;of&nbsp;children&nbsp;from&nbsp;all&nbsp;strata&nbsp;of society.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Child development through IPL</strong></h2>



<p>The IPL is a stage where raw talent meets the test of pressure, where teamwork triumphs over individual brilliance, and where losses pave the way for comebacks. Here’s how <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/khel-khel-mein-importance-of-games-in-childrens-learnings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">children can learn</a> key life lessons from IPL:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Sportsmanship:</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Players uphold respect for opponents, showcasing how victory and defeat should be handled with grace.</li>



<li>Even in intense matches, players like MS Dhoni and Rohit Sharma demonstrate humility and respect for the sport.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Resilience:</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Jasprit Bumrah’s rise from a struggling background to becoming one of the world’s best bowlers shows how setbacks are stepping stones to success.</li>



<li>Yusuf and Irfan Pathan’s journey from playing in the bylanes of Baroda to representing India is a testament to perseverance.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Teamwork &amp; Leadership:</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Captains like Dhoni and Virat Kohli lead by example, teaching children the value of teamwork and collective goals.</li>



<li>Players accept and execute their roles for the team’s greater success, teaching valuable lessons in collaboration.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Transformative game- IPL inspiring stories</strong></h2>



<p>Legends like <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/5-indian-cricketers-poor-background-made-big" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><strong>MS Dhoni, Jasprit Bumrah, and Mohammed Shami</strong></a> prove that when talent is nurtured from a young age, it can lead to extraordinary achievements. From humble beginnings to global stardom, their journeys highlight the power of opportunity, perseverance, and structured support. By inspiring millions, IPL fosters ambition, resilience, and discipline in children, reinforcing the need for grassroots sports development to unlock the vast potential hidden across India’s rural and urban landscapes.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>MS Dhoni: The Small-Town Boy Who Became a Legend</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Coming from Ranchi, a town with limited cricketing infrastructure, MS Dhoni overcame financial struggles and limited resources to become one of India’s greatest captains. His IPL journey has been a reflection of his cool-headed leadership, emphasizing that success comes to those who persist, despite the odds.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Mohammed Shami: The Journey of Grit and Determination</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Born in a small village in Uttar Pradesh, Mohammed Shami faced numerous challenges before making it to the Indian team. His hard work and never-give-up attitude have made him an inspiration for young athletes from rural backgrounds.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Jasprit Bumrah: From Tennis Ball Cricket to Global Stardom</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Coming from a modest family, Bumrah had to fight against financial constraints and infrastructural limitations. Today, he is one of the best pacers in the world, proving that dedication and persistence can overcome any barrier.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Pathan Brothers: The Power of Opportunity</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Irfan and Yusuf Pathan’s childhood was spent in a mosque in Vadodara where their father worked as a muezzin. Limited resources never stopped them from dreaming big. Their IPL success is a reminder of the importance of nurturing raw talent, especially in rural areas.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The harsh reality: Lack of extracurricular access for rural children</strong></h2>



<p>Despite India’s love for cricket, many rural children struggle to access even basic sports facilities. The<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Deiphibari-Lyngdoh/publication/378683340_CHALLENGES_OF_SPORTS_POLICY_IMPLEMENTATION_IN_INDIA_A_SPORTS_MANAGER&#039;S_PERSPECTIVE/links/65e41cf8e7670d36abeef47e/CHALLENGES-OF-SPORTS-POLICY-IMPLEMENTATION-IN-INDIA-A-SPORTS-MANAGERS-PERSPECTIVE.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> lack of proper coaching, infrastructure, and financial resources</a> prevents thousands from pursuing their dreams. Here’s a breakdown of the challenges:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-regular"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Challenges Faced by Rural Children</strong></td><td><strong>Impact</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Lack of proper sports infrastructure</td><td>No access to quality training or facilities</td></tr><tr><td>Financial constraints</td><td>Inability to afford coaching, equipment, or travel</td></tr><tr><td>Education-centric mindset</td><td>Parents often discourage sports as it is seen as non-essential</td></tr><tr><td>Gender inequality</td><td>Girls, especially in rural areas, are often denied opportunities to play</td></tr><tr><td>Lack of awareness</td><td>Many rural children remain unaware of potential sports careers</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Role of NGOs in India in bridging the gap</strong></h2>



<p>Several NGOs in India are working to provide rural children with opportunities to engage in sports and extracurricular activities. These organisations help ensure that talent does not go unnoticed due to financial or social barriers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How NGOs are making a difference</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Providing grassroots-level training programmes</li>



<li>Distributing free sports equipment</li>



<li>Organising talent scouting initiatives</li>



<li>Encouraging girls to participate in sports</li>



<li>Providing mentorship and guidance</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Linking sports with equality – A step towards SDG goals</h2>



<p>The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 10 aims to reduce inequalities, ensuring that every child, regardless of their background, gets equal opportunities. Access to sports and extracurricular activities is a fundamental right that enhances cognitive and physical development.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What experts say about sports and child development</strong></h3>



<p>According to UNICEF, “Children’s participation in sports and play is a fundamental right and essential for their physical, emotional, and social well-being.”</p>



<p>Similarly, the World <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1436" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Health</a> Organization (WHO) highlights that “Engaging in sports helps children develop resilience, teamwork, and leadership skills, which are crucial for their overall development.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How you can support rural child development</strong></h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Support NGOs in India </strong>– Contribute to organizations working to uplift rural children through sports and <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2440" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Advocate for Equal Sports Opportunities</strong> – Encourage policymakers to invest in grassroots sports development.</li>



<li><strong>Employee Engagement Activities</strong> – Use IPL as a tool to inspire young minds by discussing real-life stories of players.</li>



<li><strong>Volunteering Activities</strong>– Mentor children or participate in initiatives that promote extracurricular engagement for rural children in India.</li>



<li><strong>Encourage Local Schools to Invest in Sports </strong>– Schools in rural areas must integrate sports and extracurricular activities into their curriculum.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>IPL 2025 &#8211; A catalyst for change?</strong></h2>



<p>IPL 2025 is a cricketing spectacle and also a chance to infuse values of determination, cooperation, and ambition in young minds. But for real equality of opportunities, rural children also have to be given the support and infrastructure they deserve.</p>



<p>By partnering with NGOs in India such as Smile Foundation, you can advocate for rural child development through CSR initiatives, while leveraging major events like the IPL as a source of inspiration. Engaging employees through meaningful participation in such initiatives not only fosters motivation but also strengthens <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/the-power-of-corporate-social-partnerships-in-advancing-education/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">corporate social responsibility</a>.</p>

<p>Before Anna Hazare became the face of a protest movement in India, he was a grassroots worker in the small village of Ralegan Siddhi in Maharashtra. Through his work, he transformed the village into a model of development from being a drought-affected and poverty-stricken area. It was through the grassroots initiatives led by Anna Hazare that the villagers came together and started projects like watershed management and made their village self-sufficient. This transformation underscores the power of grassroots movements in addressing local challenges and driving rural development.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Challenges and opportunities of rural India</strong></h2>



<p>According to estimates, out of the total population of India, around <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.rur.totl.zs?locations=in" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">65 percent</a> lives in the rural areas. This is a massive number considering the total size of India’s population. This is why rural India is also the backbone of the country because of the contribution it makes through agriculture, handicrafts, traditional arts, and many small-scale industries. Rural India also contributes impressively to the economic development of the country and this is why rural consumption is an important metric of assessing India’s growth trajectory.</p>



<p>However, rural India faces persistent challenges, including poverty, lack of infrastructure, limited access to <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2439" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> and healthcare, and environmental degradation. Even today, amidst all the technological growth and diversification of livelihoods, around 47 percent of the rural population depends on agriculture for sustenance. Not just that, even with all the development, many people living in rural India still struggle for access to basic facilities like roads, clean water, electricity, healthcare, etc. Rural female <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1894901" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">labour force participation</a> has increased from 19.7% in 2018-19 to 27.7% in 2020-21, reflecting progress but also the need for further empowerment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is why, with all the challenges that rural India faces, we need robust grassroots interventions that can create community-driven solutions and bring about a needed change.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are grassroots movements?</strong></h2>



<p>Grassroots movements are those initiatives that originate from and work on the ground. They are community-driven and address the local issues of the people. This is the reason why grassroots movements are also localized and unique to every region. For example, in a region with water scarcity, grassroots movements will primarily focus on creating solutions that deal with that problem. Those solutions will not work in a region which suffers from the problem of flooding every year.</p>



<p>Unlike top-down approaches, grassroots movements originate at the local level, empowering individuals to take ownership of their development. Grassroots movements can focus on various areas, including environmental conservation, economic empowerment, social justice, <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1435" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a>, education, etc. The primary strength of any grassroots movement is its ability to mobilize the people, use the knowledge that is available locally, and create solutions that are sustainable in the long run.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Examples of grassroots movements in India</strong></h3>



<p>India being a largely rural country for decades has seen many movements that transformed the face of rural regions. Let us look at a few of them:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Chipko movement –</strong> This is perhaps a grassroots movement which most of the Indian students study about in their schools. An environment conservation movement that started as a protest against cutting down of trees became a symbol of resilience of people. During the movement, villagers, especially women, hugged the trees to prevent people from cutting them down. The movement not only protected the environment but also highlighted the role that women can play in grassroots movements.</li>



<li><strong>Narmada Bachao Andolan &#8211; </strong>Led by Medha Patkar, this movement opposed the construction of large dams on the Narmada River, which displaced thousands of tribal communities. While the movement faced challenges, it brought global attention to the rights of marginalized groups and the environmental impact of large-scale projects.</li>



<li><strong>Self-Employed Women’s Association –</strong> This is one of the grassroots movements which has created a sustainable impact and continues to do so. Self-help groups in general have helped people in rural areas to come together and support each other. In the case of SEWA, it empowered women by skilling them, providing them micro finance, and helping them set up their businesses.</li>



<li><strong>Swachh Bharat Abhiyan – </strong>Led by the prime minister of India, this movement became a grassroots initiative in both rural and urban areas, bringing people and administration together to promote cleanliness, improve sanitation facilities, and eliminate open defecation from the country.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Grassroots movements and future of rural development</strong></h2>



<p>As we move more and more towards technology and as it becomes easier to connect with each other via the internet, the question may arise about the relevance of grassroots movements. However, it is important to understand that the importance of grassroots movements cannot be ignored, especially as India continues on its growth trajectory. India can only grow if it takes along its rural areas. In future, there are some areas that India needs to put a special focus on:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Climate change –</strong> The problem is not only local, but global. India being a majorly agrarian economy, it needs to find more sustainable ways of growing crops which reduces our dependence on excessive use of water. Choosing crops that are a good alternative to water intensive farming and renewable energy can create a big impact for India and the world.</li>



<li><strong>Digital inclusion –</strong> There is no denying that digital divide exists in India and to ensure that both urban and rural populations progress in tandem, what we need is to promote digital inclusivity. This can be achieved through government intervention and providing affordable internet access in rural areas.</li>



<li><strong>Healthcare – </strong>Even today, a large number of Indians travel to major cities to receive quality healthcare support. If we want our grassroots populations to become self-sufficient, we need to ensure that they have the necessary healthcare facilities available to them locally. This can be achieved by building infrastructure and using digital tools to bring telemedicine and consultation to these areas.</li>



<li><strong><a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" title="Livelihood" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="674" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Skill development</a> and education – </strong>This is another area which can act like a game changer for India. With a large population in the working age bracket, India can either leverage the opportunity or miss out on the growth that can come by building a productive workforce.</li>



<li><strong>Women’s empowerment – </strong>Lastly, India needs to focus heavily on promoting gender equality and empowerment of women because they make up half of the country&#8217;s population. By including them in the Indian growth story, the country can move forward at a much faster pace.</li>
</ol>



<p>Grassroots movements have the potential to transform rural India by addressing local challenges, empowering communities, and fostering sustainable development. The success stories of Ralegan Siddhi, the Chipko Movement, and SEWA demonstrate the power of collective action and community-driven solutions. As India looks to the future, investing in grassroots movements and supporting local leadership will be crucial for achieving inclusive growth and bridging the urban-rural divide. By harnessing the energy and aspirations of rural communities, India can build a more equitable and prosperous society for all.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smile Foundation strengthening grassroots organizations</strong></h3>



<p>Smile Foundation supports grassroots organizations through its &#8216;<a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/ctgi/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Empowering Grassroots</a>&#8216; programme, which aims to enhance the capabilities of community-based organizations (CBOs) to achieve local sustainability and effectiveness. This initiative aligns with India&#8217;s &#8216;Atmanirbhar Bharat&#8217; mission by focusing on several key areas:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Capacity Building:</strong> The programme offers training in governance, leadership, communication, fundraising, and resource mobilization to help CBOs improve their organizational planning and operational efficiency.<br></li>



<li><strong>Workshops and Training Sessions:</strong> Regular workshops and face-to-face learning sessions are conducted throughout the year, enabling CBOs to address operational challenges and maximize their impact on the ground.<br></li>



<li><strong>Promoting Local Fundraising:</strong> The foundation emphasizes mobilizing local support to reduce dependency on foreign resources, fostering self-reliance among grassroots organizations.<br></li>
</ul>



<p>Through these efforts, Smile Foundation has built the capacities of over 500 grassroots development organizations, strengthening the base of India&#8217;s socio-economic pyramid and promoting sustainable community development.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Happiness is a feeling that cannot be confined to a single definition. Its beauty lies in the endless ways it can manifest — through small moments of joy, acts of kindness, and the simple act of a smile.</p>



<p>On World Happiness Day, Smile Foundation celebrates its ongoing commitment to spreading smiles across India through comprehensive interventions in education, health, women empowerment, and livelihood. The foundation believes that true happiness stems from the security of good <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1430" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a>, access to quality education, and opportunities for economic independence.</p>



<p>Despite India’s progress, 25.01% of the population still lives below the poverty line (NITI Aayog, 2023), struggling to meet basic essentials. Additionally, 18% of women lack access to maternal healthcare (UNICEF, 2023). Addressing these gaps, Smile Foundation’s holistic approach supports vulnerable communities, fostering inclusive growth.</p>



<p>With the support of corporate and community partners, Smile Foundation transforms lives, nurturing self-reliance and resilience and therefore, this World Happiness Day, Smile reaffirms its dedication to building a healthier, happier India, where every smile is a step towards collective well-being.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Lifecycle Approach: From Smile to Happiness</strong></h2>



<p>In a country as diverse as India, the meaning of happiness varies for each individual. For some, happiness is found in quality <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2433" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a>; for others, it is the security of good health or the pride of financial independence. Yet, for millions in underserved regions, even the basics of survival can be a distant dream.</p>



<p>Understanding this reality, Smile Foundation’s <strong>Lifecycle Approach</strong> takes a holistic path to empowerment. Through interventions in education, healthcare, women’s empowerment, and livelihoods, we strive to ensure that every child and family has a fair chance to experience happiness.</p>



<p>To date, we have reached over<strong> 20,00,000 children and their families through 400 projects spread across 2,000 villages across India</strong> — each story adding a new chapter to the collective joy we nurture.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Smile Begins with a Healthy Mother and Child</strong></h3>



<p>A mother’s joy is often reflected in the well-being of her child. Swabhiman, aligned with SDGs 3, 5, and 8, our flagship programme on good health of women and their financial stability. While, its one branch focuses on maternal and child health, ensuring that every mother has the knowledge, support, and resources she needs to give her child a healthy start in life through-.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Community-Led Initiatives</li>
</ul>



<p>Mothers’ Meetings foster peer learning among pregnant and lactating women, while Community Kitchen Gardens ensure sustainable access to nutritious food.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Specialised Health Camps</li>
</ul>



<p>Qualified professionals provide essential check-ups, screenings, and counselling, ensuring early detection and timely treatment.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Reproductive &amp; Child Health Support</li>
</ul>



<p>Women receive crucial guidance on maternal and child healthcare, enhancing well-being and promoting informed decision-making.</p>



<p><strong>Empowering Women Entrepreneurs</strong></p>



<p>On the other hand, Swabhiman, also foster economic independence by equipping women with financial literacy,<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4NsBQch0r8/?igsh=MTNud2Ixa2xuamt0Zw%3D%3D" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> entrepreneurial skills</a>, and business mentorship, it empowers them to pursue their aspirations and build secure futures. </p>



<p>&nbsp;In 2024 alone, <strong>1,90,000 women </strong>across 6 states gained access to Swabhiman’s support, driving meaningful change in their communities.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Education: Unlocking the Joy of Learning</strong></h3>



<p>For a child, the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4NsBQch0r8/?igsh=MTNud2Ixa2xuamt0Zw%3D%3D" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">opportunity to learn</a> is often the greatest source of happiness. Mission Education, Smile Foundation’s education initiative, ensures that children from underserved communities do not lose their right to dream.</p>



<p><strong>Our Impact in 2024:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>1,60,000 children across 27 states gained access to quality education.</li>



<li>STEM Education: Encouraging scientific thinking and problem-solving.</li>



<li>Aligned with NEP 2020 and G-20 Goals: Promoting foundational literacy and numeracy.</li>



<li>Digital Classrooms: Bridging the digital divide through solar-powered learning centers, educational tablets, and interactive tools, reaching over 15,000 children.</li>
</ul>



<p>Every effort to take quality education through new age educational resources and classroom is to ensure that  a space of curiosity and growth is created around children, ensuring that they can embrace their futures with confidence and hope.</p>
