					<description><![CDATA[<p>In India, crimes against women remain alarmingly high ranging from domestic violence and dowry deaths to acid attacks and sexual assault. Over 29% of women report intimate partner violence, while around 7,000 dowry-related deaths occur annually. These numbers reflect deep-rooted inequalities. Smile Foundation is working at the grassroots to empower women and girls through education, health, and leadership training.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Crimes against women – ranging from domestic abuse to sexual assault – are a pervasive global issue. The World Health Organization estimates that at least one in three women worldwide has experienced physical or sexual violence in her lifetime. In India, entrenched patriarchal norms and economic dependency often compound the problem. Official data show disturbing trends: the 2022 NCRB report recorded <strong>66.4 crimes per 100,000 women</strong>, up from 58.8 in 2018 (a 12.9% increase). Most reported cases are domestic (31.4% involve cruelty by husbands or relatives) or sexual (7.1% are rape cases). </p>



<p>Even workplace harassment is rising. Complaints under the POSH Act grew from 402 in 2018 to 422 in 2022. Globally too the toll is high – in 2022 about 89,000 women and girls were victims of intentional homicide – and South Asia bears a heavy burden. India, ranked <strong>128th out of 177 countries on women’s security in 2023</strong>, continues to see heinous crimes despite legal reforms.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="825" height="519" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/violence-against-women-increase.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14205" style="width:394px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/violence-against-women-increase.jpg 825w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/violence-against-women-increase-300x189.jpg 300w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/violence-against-women-increase-768x483.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></figure>



<p><em><strong>Chart: </strong></em>Reported crimes against women in India climbed from 58.8 to 66.4 per 100,000 women between 2018 and 2022 (NCRB data). This 12.9% rise highlights growing violence and/or better reporting.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-forms-of-violence-against-women"><strong>Forms of violence against women</strong></h2>



<p>Crimes against women take many forms, all rooted in gender inequality. Major categories include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Domestic violence</strong> – Physical, emotional or sexual abuse by a husband or family member (cruelty under IPC §498A). This is the most common crime: about 31.4% of all reported violence against women in India is “cruelty by husband/relatives”. Such abuse can range from beatings and intimidation to coerced suicide.</li>



<li><strong>Sexual assault and harassment</strong> – Non-consensual acts like <strong>rape</strong>, molestation and sexual abuse. Rape accounted for 7.1% of crimes against women in 2022, though experts note under-reporting. Outraging a woman’s modesty (molestation) was 18.7% of cases. At the workplace or in public spaces, harassment (now punishable under the 2013 <em>POSH Act</em>) is also widespread.</li>



<li><strong>Dowry Harassment and Death</strong> – Demands for dowry often lead to cruelty and even murder. Despite legal bans, thousands of cases are reported annually. In 2020 India logged about 10,366 dowry harassment cases and 6,966 dowry deaths. Victims may face torture or death when in-laws demand more gifts or money.</li>



<li><strong>Trafficking and exploitation</strong> – Women and girls are trafficked for sexual or labour exploitation. This includes prostitution and bonded labour (IPC 370–372). Many young women are lured or kidnapped into a network of abuse. Under special laws, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11288248/#:~:text=%2817%29,Information%20on%20female" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">immoral trafficking</a> and buying/selling of minor girls are recognised offences.</li>



<li><strong>Child marriage and child abuse</strong> – Forced underage marriage and sexual exploitation of minors violates the law (Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, POCSO Act). Adolescent girls are especially vulnerable to rape and forced marriage, which carry their own penalties. Child marriage is officially banned, but enforcement gaps persist.</li>



<li><strong>Honour killings and witch-hunting</strong> – In some regions, women are murdered by relatives for perceived &#8216;honour&#8217; violations (e.g., marrying outside caste) or accused of witchcraft. These extrajudicial crimes are rooted in superstition and patriarchy. The government has special provisions, but cases still surface in tribal and rural areas.</li>



<li><strong>Acid attacks</strong> – Deliberate pouring of acid (often by rejected suitors or relatives) to disfigure women. Since 2013 acid attacks are a distinct crime (IPC 326A) punishable by <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2016/3/10/indian-acid-attack-victims-share-their-stories#:~:text=Effective%20from%20February%202013%2C%20with,and%20a%20maximum%20of%20life" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">10 years to life imprisonment</a>. However, cases have risen. Media reports cite hundreds of attacks a year. Acid violence is most common in South Asia; Bangladesh’s strict laws have reduced attacks by ~20–30%, but India continues to see many incidents.</li>



<li><strong>Cyber and online abuse</strong> – Digital stalking, harassment, non-consensual sharing of images (&#8216;revenge porn&#8217;), and bullying of women online. This emerging threat is covered under IT laws, but enforcement is still developing. A recent NCRB category &#8216;cybercrime against women&#8217; reflects this growing trend.</li>
</ul>



<p>These forms often overlap and compound one another. For example, a woman facing dowry torture may also be raped or threatened with acid. Children can be victims of sexual abuse at home or trafficked. In India, the United Nations notes that gender-based violence includes all these facets – domestic abuse, dowry violence, honor crimes, acid attacks and more. Each form leaves deep scars on survivors and families.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-impact-of-violence"><strong>Impact of violence</strong></h2>



<p>The consequences of crimes against women are devastating on multiple levels. Physically, victims suffer injuries, chronic pain, disabilities or unwanted pregnancies. Psychologically, they face trauma, depression, stigma and loss of trust. Many survivors struggle with social isolation and economic hardship, as abuse often destroys livelihoods. </p>



<p>According to public <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2646" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> experts, these individual impacts add up. Violence increases women’s health problems, can lead to STIs or death, and even disrupts entire families. At a societal level, gender-based violence violates basic human rights and undermines development goals. It reduces women’s participation in <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2647" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> and the workforce, cutting productivity. UN reports warn that such violence hinders progress on Sustainable Development Goals (like good health, equality, and decent work).</p>



<p>In India, these impacts are compounded by social and economic factors. Many women lack financial independence or legal awareness, making it hard to escape abusive situations. For instance, under many custom and inheritance norms women cannot claim property, and most work in informal jobs without protection. </p>



<p>The National Family Health Survey (2019–21) found <strong>29.3% of women aged 18–49</strong> have experienced spousal violence in their lifetime. Even if crimes are reported, justice can be slow; patriarchal attitudes often blame victims or discourage their testimony. As a result, many cases never enter the official record at all. Experts note that cultural shame and fear of retaliation are huge barriers to reporting.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WOMEN-EMPOWERMENT-IN-INDIA-Initiatives-Driving-Chang-Change-2-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14209" style="width:366px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WOMEN-EMPOWERMENT-IN-INDIA-Initiatives-Driving-Chang-Change-2-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WOMEN-EMPOWERMENT-IN-INDIA-Initiatives-Driving-Chang-Change-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WOMEN-EMPOWERMENT-IN-INDIA-Initiatives-Driving-Chang-Change-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WOMEN-EMPOWERMENT-IN-INDIA-Initiatives-Driving-Chang-Change-2.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></figure>



<p>Real stories illustrate these hardships. <strong><a href="https://www.gicj.org/lest-we-forget/2874-laxmi-agarwal-the-acid-attack-survivor#:~:text=Laxmi%20Agarwal%20was%2015%20years,1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Laxmi Agarwal</a></strong>, for example, was just 15 when a jilted man threw acid on her. She spent years in surgery and faced social stigma, even as she tirelessly campaigned for stricter acid laws. Her efforts (and similar ones by activists) led the Supreme Court in 2013 to impose tighter controls on acid sales and higher compensation for survivors. Today Laxmi heads a foundation that helps fellow survivors rebuild their lives. Her courage shows how victims can become voices for change but it also underscores the brutality of these crimes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-legal-protections-and-government-schemes"><strong>Legal protections and government schemes</strong></h2>



<p>India has a broad legal framework to address violence against women. Key laws include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>IPC 498A</strong> (Cruelty by husband/relatives) – Penalises physical or mental cruelty to women in marriage, including dowry demands.</li>



<li><strong>Protection of women from Domestic Violence Act (2005)</strong> – Allows survivors to seek protection orders, residence rights, and maintenance from abusive partners.</li>



<li><strong>IPC 304B</strong> (Dowry Death) – Punishes death of a bride within 7 years of marriage if dowry harassment is proven.</li>



<li><strong>Dowry Prohibition Act (1961)</strong> – Bans requesting or giving dowry gifts; harassment under this Act saw over 13,000 cases in 2019.</li>



<li><strong>POCSO Act (2012)</strong> – Protects children (including girl children) from sexual offences with stringent penalties.</li>



<li><strong>Criminal Law (Amendment) Acts (2013, 2018)</strong> – Enacted after high-profile cases, these strengthened rape laws (including fast-track courts, death penalty for gang-rape), and clarified offenses like stalking and acid attacks.</li>



<li><strong>Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act (2013)</strong> – Mandates employers to prevent and address sexual harassment on the job (though social awareness and complaint rates remain low).</li>
</ul>



<p>Beyond laws, the government runs many schemes and support systems. For victims of violence, <strong>One Stop Centres</strong> (also called <em>Sakhi </em>Centres) were launched in 2015 to provide integrated aid. These centers offer medical care, legal counselling, police liaison, and temporary shelter under one roof for survivors of domestic or public violence. The Ministry of Women &amp; Child Development reports over 708 One Stop Centres were operational by 2022, assisting 540,000 women nationwide.</p>



<p>Other initiatives include a 24×7 Women’s Helpline (1091/181) and the unified emergency number 112 for immediate assistance; <em><strong>Beti Bachao Beti Padhao</strong> </em>campaign to promote girl child welfare; <strong>Safe City Projects</strong> (in major cities) installing CCTV and better lighting; and <strong>Mahila Adalats</strong> (special women’s courts) for resolving complaints quickly. Police stations also now have <strong>Women’s Help Desks</strong> for gender-sensitive handling of cases. </p>



<p>Funds from the <strong>Nirbhaya Fund</strong> are used for training investigators, setting up trauma rooms, and providing forensic kits to speed up rape case trials. The National Commission for Women (NCW) itself operates a dedicated WhatsApp helpline (72177-35372) to report violence. All these measures aim to plug gaps in the system.</p>



<p>Despite the laws, enforcement is uneven. Experts urge further action. Educational campaigns in schools, community-level gender-sensitisation, and better funding for support services. For example, the Women’s Commission notes that combining legal aid with job training and counselling is crucial to help survivors rebuild independent lives. In other words, legal remedies must go hand-in-hand with social change to truly curb these crimes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crimes-against-women-india-vs-global-context"><strong>Crimes against women: India vs. Global context</strong></h2>



<p>While violence against women is universal, its shape and prevalence vary by region. Globally, WHO data indicate that about 30% of women experience intimate partner or sexual violence in their lives. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reported nearly 89,000 gender-related homicides of women/girls worldwide in 2022. South Asia bears a disproportionate share of certain crimes. </p>



<p><strong>For example, India – like neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh – has historically high rates of acid attacks and honour killings. Notably, Bangladesh’s strict acid laws have led to a 20–30% decline in attacks, a success India still strives for.</strong></p>



<p>India’s Women Peace and Security Index rank (128/177 in 2023) trails most developed countries. Factors include continuing social inequality, access to justice, and political representation. In some metrics India outperforms its neighbours. According to the 2021 National Family Health Survey, the child sex ratio (females per 1000 males) improved to 1020, indicating progress against female infanticide. </p>



<p>However, in crime statistics the picture is worrisome. The NCRB found criminal cases against women per 100,000 population are significantly higher in states like Delhi (144.4) and Haryana (118.7) than the national average.</p>



<p>It’s clear that India’s challenge is both similar to and worse than global trends. Like many countries, India struggles with under-reporting and stigma. But deeply rooted gender bias and large population density mean even a small percentage of unreported crimes translates to very high absolute numbers. </p>



<p>Comparing international data underscores that every country has a stake in solutions – from enforcing international conventions to sharing best practices. India’s recent improvements in laws and awareness are positive, but the on-ground reality still lags behind many peers.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-empowering-women-and-girls-the-role-of-smile-foundation">Empowering women and girls – The role of Smile Foundation</h2>



<p>Stopping crimes against women requires prevention and empowerment, not just punishment. Smile Foundation addresses root causes by empowering women and girls in vulnerable communities. Our flagship <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/donation/women-empowerment" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Swabhiman</a> programme </strong>(launched in 2005) offers a holistic mix of health, nutrition, and livelihood support to marginalised women. </p>



<p>Swabhiman helps women start microenterprises, learn financial literacy, and access healthcare. For instance, Smile provides skill training (e.g. sewing, farming) along with seed capital, so beneficiaries can earn their own income.</p>

<p><em><strong>Image: </strong></em>A Smile Foundation beneficiary uses vocational training (here, tailoring) and support to build a <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" title="Livelihood" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2645" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">livelihood</a>. Programmes like Swabhiman equip women with skills, tools and awareness, enabling them to earn independently.</p>



<p>Smile’s approach ties into broader development goals by combining reproductive health awareness with entrepreneurship, Swabhiman makes women more self-reliant. In practical terms, <strong>nearly 190,000 women</strong> across six states have benefitted from Swabhiman in recent years. These women learn to plan family health, start savings, and even lead local groups. For example, in Maharashtra Smile recounts how <em>Ishwati</em> – once a daily-wage laborer – received seeds, a pump and training to start farming. She now <strong>earns about ₹10,000</strong> from selling her crops, supplementing her family’s income and inspiring others in her village. Stories like hers show that when women gain skills and confidence, they can resist exploitation and lift their families out of poverty.</p>



<p>Smile also focuses on educating and empowering girls. Our <strong><em><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/donation/support-girl-child" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">She Can Fly</a></em></strong> initiative (alongside other campaigns) encourages girls to stay in school, get vocational training and focus on health and nutrition. Educated girls are far less likely to be married off early or fall prey to traffickers. By promoting financial literacy and life skills, Smile helps girls become <strong>change agents</strong> in their own communities. Together, these programmes aim to reduce vulnerability. We believe that an informed, skilled woman is better able to assert her rights and avoid abusive situations.</p>



<p>For donors and policymakers, Smile’s impact is a model worth supporting. The organisation’s integrated work – combining <strong>nutrition programmes</strong>, <strong>reproductive health camps</strong>, and <strong>women’s entrepreneurship</strong> – addresses several risk factors for violence. Recognising this, Smile aligns with national schemes (like Anemia Mukt Bharat and Poshan Abhiyan) to strengthen government initiatives. </p>



<p>Our partnerships have helped set up community kitchens, support mothers’ groups, and equip health workers to be more responsive to women’s needs. In short, Smile Foundation illustrates how empowerment and awareness can complement laws to actually reduce crimes against women.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-can-be-done"><strong>What can be done</strong></h2>



<p>Experts emphasise a multi-pronged approach by educating boys and girls about gender equality, sensitising communities, strictly enforcing laws, and expanding support for survivors. Engaging youth is vital – curricula and media must challenge stereotypes that condone violence. Policymakers must ensure funding for women’s shelters, legal aid, and healthcare is adequate and effectively used. The public can play a role by supporting and volunteering with NGOs like Smile that empower at-risk women.</p>



<p>Real change also needs cultural shifts. Indian society must move beyond protective attitudes to genuinely value women’s autonomy. Everyday citizens can help by speaking out against harassment, supporting survivors, and demanding accountability. Even small steps – a bystander intervening in public harassment, or communities educating young couples about mutual respect – can add up.</p>



<p>In India and around the world, ending crimes against women will require everyone’s effort. The legal toolbox is in place, but enforcement and social support must be strengthened. Programmes like Smile Foundation’s Swabhiman and She Can Fly show that empowering women economically and socially can break the cycle of abuse. By combining legal remedies with education and opportunity, society can turn the tide – ensuring every woman and girl can live free of violence.</p>

<p>Well-functioning Anganwadi Centres are the backbone of India’s early childhood development and maternal-child health programmes. Nearly <strong><a href="https://www.godrejfoundation.com/blogs/fifty-years-of-anganwadis-are-they-effective-pre-schools#:~:text=In%202025%2C%20as%20the%20scheme,and%20supplementary%20nutrition%20at%20anganwadis" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">14 lakh Anganwadis</a></strong> across India serve as the first point of contact for nutrition, health monitoring, and preschool education for rural and urban poor children. In 2025, these centres provide hot meals, immunisations and growth tracking for 0–6 year-olds, and critical prenatal/postnatal care to pregnant and lactating women. </p>



<p>ASER 2024 data show that Anganwadis are the biggest provider of pre-primary school services, with over half of all 3–4 year olds enrolled there. These figures highlight that Anganwadis not only fight malnutrition (child undernutrition fell from ~30% in 1975 to 7.7% by 2019–21) but also prime millions of children for school.</p>



<p>Across India, Anganwadis are often simple village centres providing early <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2636" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> and nutrition. Upgrading these facilities as advocated by NEP 2020 is essential for quality learning and <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2634" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-glaring-anganwadi-infrastructure-gaps-undermine-outcomes"><strong>Glaring Anganwadi infrastructure gaps undermine outcomes</strong></h2>



<p>On-the-ground surveys reveal alarming deficits in Anganwadi infrastructure. Recent data from Telangana expose how thousands of centres lack basic amenities. Out of <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/telangana/2025/Jul/02/41-per-cent-anganwadis-lack-electricity-over-30-per-cent-have-no-toilet-facilities#:~:text=Data%20accessed%20by%20TNIE%20reveals,healthy%20and%20dignified%20learning%20environment" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">35,700 Anganwadis</a> surveyed, 41% (14,866 centres) had no electricity, crippling lighting, ventilation, and cold-storage of vaccines and supplements. Similarly, 32.5% (11,595 centres) had no toilet facilities, jeopardising sanitation and dignity, especially for girls and women. And 16.8% (5,981 centres) lacked drinking water access. These gaps directly violate Swachh Bharat and Poshan Abhiyaan goals, and mirror a wider pattern.</p>



<p>A 2020 NITI Aayog review found that a majority of Anganwadis still operate in rented or makeshift spaces, not permanent government-built rooms. The consequences are crumbling walls, overcrowding, and AWWs unable to teach or even cook mid-day meals. For example, in one Odisha Anganwadi shown below, children sit under a leaking roof, illustrating the urgent need for upgrades.</p>



<p>Many Anganwadis today lack safe, child-friendly buildings. In rural Odisha (pictured), a worn-down Anganwadi centre struggles to serve mothers and children in inadequate space, underscoring why state action is needed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="598" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Dz6lhFPWkAI0dEd-1024x598.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14169" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Dz6lhFPWkAI0dEd-1024x598.jpg 1024w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Dz6lhFPWkAI0dEd-300x175.jpg 300w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Dz6lhFPWkAI0dEd-768x448.jpg 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Dz6lhFPWkAI0dEd-1536x896.jpg 1536w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Dz6lhFPWkAI0dEd-1200x700.jpg 1200w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Dz6lhFPWkAI0dEd-1980x1155.jpg 1980w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Dz6lhFPWkAI0dEd.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-case-for-renewed-investment"><strong>The case for renewed investment</strong></h2>



<p>As NEP 2020 notes, the early years are crucial not just for physical development but also cognitive and emotional growth. High-quality, child-friendly infrastructure (safe classrooms, play areas, sanitation, and power) is now explicitly mandated by policy. Indeed, states like UP and Maharashtra are hiring dedicated pre-school teachers and rolling out new curricula in Anganwadis. But to meet these goals, existing centres must be upgraded in tandem.</p>



<p>In practical terms, infrastructure translates to a well-lit, ventilated Anganwadi with clean water and toilets. It boosts attendance, learning and health. In Telangana, Anganwadi Workers report they cannot adopt digital or creative teaching methods without electricity. When toilets and water are absent, young children, and caregivers face illness and indignity. Conversely, interventions that improve the centre environment (e.g. furniture, cooking facilities, kitchen gardens) lead to higher community trust and programme uptake.</p>



<p><strong>Smile Foundation’s own experience confirms this. </strong>With PepsiCo Foundation, Smile implemented the <strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/smile-foundation-and-pepsico-join-forces-to-strengthen-healthcare-and-nutrition-for-underserved-communities/#:~:text=Complementing%20this%20effort%20is%20the,community%20engagement%2C%20260%20health%20camps" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Nutrition Enhancement Programme (NEP)</a></strong> in rural Punjab. Over three years, NEP improved maternal-child nutrition in 23 villages of Sangrur, reaching 60,000 people. This CSR-backed initiative directly benefited 16,000 pregnant/lactating women and children and indirectly another 45,000, through 260 health camps, kitchen gardens and AWW training. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ChatGPT-Image-Jul-25-2025-08_29_56-PM-683x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14167" style="width:370px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ChatGPT-Image-Jul-25-2025-08_29_56-PM-683x1024.png 683w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ChatGPT-Image-Jul-25-2025-08_29_56-PM-200x300.png 200w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ChatGPT-Image-Jul-25-2025-08_29_56-PM-768x1152.png 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ChatGPT-Image-Jul-25-2025-08_29_56-PM.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></figure>



<p>Likewise, in Kosi (Mathura, UP), the recent <strong><a href="https://thecsrjournal.in/corporate-social-responsibility-csr-news-pepsico-india-and-smile-foundation-partner-to-combat-anaemia-and-malnutrition-in-kosi-through-pink-smile-initiative/#:~:text=,Officer%20of%20the%20Nandgaon%20block" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Pink Smile</a></strong> project (PepsiCo–Smile) deployed mobile medical units and community camps to screen and treat anemia for 4,200 vulnerable women and children. These projects underscore how supporting Anganwadi-based care yields immediate health gains.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smile-foundation-s-anganwadi-infrastructure-initiatives"><strong>Smile Foundation’s Anganwadi infrastructure initiatives</strong></h2>



<p>Building on this evidence, Smile Foundation has launched dedicated Anganwadi infrastructure programmes through <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" title="Corporate Partnerships" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2635" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">CSR</a> partnerships. In Maharashtra, the <strong><a href="https://thecsrjournal.in/csr-news-non-profit-foundations-empower-lives-anganwadi-transformation-pune/#:~:text=,Anganwadi%20workers%20and%20local%20families" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Mars Wrigley Foundation’s Community Connection grant</a></strong> empowered us to revamp 10 Anganwadi Centres (AWCs) across Pune. Over 2024–25 we revitalised 10 AWCs, impacting 13 centres overall, reaching 1,562 direct beneficiaries (children, mothers, adolescent girls) and 4,660 community members. </p>



<p>Key upgrades included 202 kitchen gardens to improve food security, 30 health/haemoglobin screening camps, and training for Anganwadi workers. We provided furniture, learning materials and safe sanitation creating cleaner, child-friendly learning spaces.</p>



<p>Similarly, under our <strong>Women Empowerment (<a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/women-empowerment/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Swabhiman</a>)</strong> programme in Tamil Nadu, Odisha and other states, Smile has supported Anganwadi upgrades by building toilets, installing solar lights, and water filters, and training AWWs in hygiene and nutrition. Our anaemia and nutrition mobile units also regularly link families to their Anganwadi Centres. All these efforts from Assam to Andhra Pradesh illustrate Smile’s conviction that investing in Anganwadis today builds healthier, more educated communities tomorrow.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-practical-csr-partnerships-for-lasting-impact"><strong>Practical CSR partnerships for lasting impact</strong></h2>



<p>For CSR leaders seeking high-impact opportunities, Anganwadi upgradation should be a strategic priority. We recommend:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Adopt &amp; Upgrade:</strong> Corporates can &#8216;adopt&#8217; clusters of Anganwadis (or a mini-Anganwadi cluster) in partnership with NGOs like us. Funding can go to core infrastructure like permanent classrooms, clean toilets, borewells or piped water, electricity/smart lighting, boundary walls, and kitchen equipment.</li>



<li><strong>Nutrition &amp; Nurture:</strong> Enhance the centre’s nutrition role by sponsoring kitchen gardens, community nutrition workshops, and improved kitchen-cum-store facilities. These immediately improve the meal program’s reach.</li>



<li><strong>Capacity Building:</strong> Invest in training Anganwadi workers (AWWs/AWHs) on early childhood pedagogy, health screening, digital tools and gender sensitivity so that physical upgrades yield programme quality gains.</li>



<li><strong>Monitoring &amp; Community:</strong> Collaborate with local panchayats and beneficiaries in planning; involve employees as volunteers (e.g. helping refurbish centres). Set measurable outcomes (enrollment, health indicators, attendance) and share progress publicly.</li>
</ul>



<p>The government’s own task force advises that <strong>public-private partnerships (PPPs)</strong> are vital to bridge the gap in ICDS service delivery. By partnering with NGOs like Smile Foundation who bring field expertise, CSR units can ensure sustainable models. For example, Mars Wrigley’s multi-year support combined fresh infrastructure inputs with IEC campaigns and AWW training. Such integrated projects create lasting change far beyond a one-time donation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-child-friendly-futures"><strong>Building child-friendly futures</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="869" height="813" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-202910.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14168" style="width:372px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-202910.png 869w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-202910-300x281.png 300w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-25-202910-768x719.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></figure>



<p>Well-equipped Anganwadi centres are an enabler of national development. They lay the foundation for healthier, smarter generations. </p>



<p>Smile Foundation calls on policymakers and CSR leaders to make Anganwadi upgradation a national mission. By collectively funding and maintaining model Anganwadis, India can accelerate the goals of POSHAN Abhiyaan, Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao, and universal preschool education. Every rupee invested yields returns in reduced malnutrition, better schooling outcomes and empowered mothers. We urge CSR heads to engage <a href="cp@smilefoundationindia.org" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">now</a>. Your strategic CSR priorities can transform Anganwadis into vibrant community hubs, ensuring no child misses out on a strong start in life.</p>



<p><strong>Sources:</strong> Government and media reports highlight the infrastructural shortfalls in Anganwadis, and policy analyses recommend urgent upgrades. The outcomes of Smile Foundation’s CSR partnerships (with PepsiCo, Mars Wrigley, etc.) document the impact of targeted Anganwadi improvements. All facts and figures above are drawn from these reports and our project data.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>In the remote hills of Uttarakhand, women are rewriting their destinies. Through Smile Foundation’s Empowering Grassroots programme, in partnership with AMAN, over ten villages in Almora are witnessing a change. Women are breaking social barriers, preserving indigenous knowledge, and advocating for their communities with renewed confidence. With training in leadership, governance, and fundraising, local changemakers are leading change from within, proving that when women rise, even the steepest mountains can be overcome.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the remote valley of Kansar in Uttarakhand’s Almora district, something extraordinary is unfolding. In villages once defined by silence and tradition, women are beginning to speak — not just in whispers within kitchens but in full voice at Panchayat meetings, health forums, and even as first-time breadwinners. Through the efforts of Smile Foundation’s <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/support-women-empowerment/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Swabhiman</a> initiative, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/smile-foundation_when-women-begin-to-believe-in-themselves-activity-7346518507989123075-rnC0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADgTDtkB93yU-Rhkq6MtWdjk8CU8K1895Uw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">AMAN</a>, more than ten villages are witnessing a remarkable transformation as women shatter barriers that were once deemed insurmountable. One of the main goals of the UNDP&#8217;s Sustainable Development Goals is to promote gender equality and give women more authority. It means giving women the same rights, chances, and access to resources as men, which lets them make their own decisions and have control over their life.</p>



<p>The conversations with women reveal a calmness and strength, punctuated by moments of shy laughter and proud smiles. Some&nbsp;express themselves with a quiet yet unwavering certainty, others who radiate enthusiasm as they recount the transformative shifts in their lives from learning to manage money and <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2622" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> to speaking in group discussions. Their expressions convey a profound sense of joy intertwined with the dignity that arises from being acknowledged and valued.</p>



<p>At the heart of Swabhiman lies a profound belief that when women believe in themselves, they gain the power to change not only their own lives but also the lives of those around them. Through a series of educational workshops focused on health, hygiene, and nutrition, these women are arming themselves with knowledge that is essential for their well-being and that of their families.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-shift-from-silence-to-strength-for-the-hilly-women"><strong>A shift From silence to strength for the hilly women</strong></h2>



<p>Hilly women are now meeting monthly in spaces that were once silent. They openly discuss menstruation, nutrition, and finances — topics that were previously off-limits. This new camaraderie not only encourages learning but also empowers women to take on leadership roles in their communities. These monthly meetings beyond administrative updates are essential lifelines of awareness. Discussions cover key themes, such as sensible financial management, the fundamental rights we uphold, and important aspects of hygiene and cleanliness, and parenting. Every woman deserves knowledge, and with that knowledge comes power.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-health-hygiene-and-hope"><strong>Health, hygiene, and hope</strong></h2>



<p>The foundation of this transformation is <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2623" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a>, particularly about health, nutrition, and well-being. These are not merely “women’s issues”; they form the bedrock of society. Hilly women trained through this programme now openly discuss menstrual health and sanitation, which they never talked about. The programme prioritises the provision of accessible and comprehensive reproductive health services, education, and resources. Such initiatives are essential for enhancing the health status of mothers, infants, and children alike. Empowering pregnant women and mothers through knowledge and promoting behaviour changes are essential for better health outcomes and healthy food habits.</p>



<p>With accurate information, women are becoming the first responders to health issues at home and influential figures in their communities.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-collective-action"><strong>Collective action</strong></h3>



<p>The kitchen has long symbolised the limits faced by rural women, reflecting their restricted lives. In Almora, it is turning into a launchpad. By monetising their skills such as cooking, tailoring, or running small businesses, these women are redefining independence. Sourcing local fruits and other raw materials, they make biscuits and juices that are pure, seasonal, and chemical-free. Women learned to make juices from scratch, as a meaningful way to improve their skills. Some had the necessary tools; what they really needed was support and encouragement. These skills have turned into a potential <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" title="Livelihood" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2621" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">livelihood</a>. The real inspiration comes from the unity we see among these women.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One participant succinctly expressed it<em> </em>sharing,<em> “Sangthan ke madhyam se mahilayein ekjuth ho gayi hain. Kaheen par kuch galat ho raha hai, toh kehti hai ki hume usey sudhaarna hai.”</em> (Women have come together through the organisation. If something goes wrong someplace, they say we have to fix it.&#8221;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-financial-confidence-and-unity"><strong>Financial confidence and unity</strong></h3>



<p>The financial literacy component of the programme acts as a vital tool, equipping women with the essential knowledge and skills needed to navigate the complexities of financial management effectively. The ability to earn, save, and spend wisely has become crucial skills that women are increasingly mastering.</p>



<p>Behind every confident woman in Almora, stand the project coordinators from Smile Foundation and AMAN, who walk tirelessly on rocky and uneven trails to reach the remote villages. They carry teaching aids, health kits, training material and lots of ideas and hope.</p>



<p>“No mountain too high for women” is a reality when women are trusted, trained, and treated as equals. In Almora, we see what happens Smile Foundation and AMAN focus on belief, not just need. There is a lesson here for India. The path to equity doesn’t always start in Parliament or on paper. Sometimes, it starts in a circle of women, sitting under a tree, discussing their dreams.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The world is beginning to pay attention to the world of handicrafts. It’s common to see popular reels on social media featuring women from village communities doing intricate <em><strong>Aari </strong></em>work or block printing or engaging in any handwork. Even leading fashion designers and lifestyle brands are acknowledging this trend and including embroidery in their contemporary collections. This shows us that handmade items aren’t outdated but a form of high art. </p>



<p>Craftsmanship is gaining global recognition. Today’s buyers want to know who made their clothes and products, and how they were made. This growing demand for authenticity presents a unique opportunity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The handicrafts sector stands as a cornerstone of the Indian economy, providing livelihoods to over seven million individuals. The total exports of handicrafts were valued at <a href="https://www.ibef.org/exports/handicrafts-industry-india" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">INR 31,095 crore (US$ 3.8 billion) in FY24</a>.&nbsp; Its significance cannot be overstated, as it embodies the rich cultural heritage and craftsmanship that define the nation.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stitching-new-beginnings-with-aari-work"><strong>Stitching new beginnings with <em>Aari </em>work</strong></h2>



<p>In a small workshop tucked away in the bustling streets of India, a group of women are gathered, their nimble fingers deftly weaving vibrant fabrics, shaping intricate beadwork, and breathing life into stunning handmade creations. These are the women of Smile Foundation&#8217;s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/smile-foundation_swabhiman-womenempowerment-financialindependence-activity-7345364268336222208-ec4C/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADgTDtkB93yU-Rhkq6MtWdjk8CU8K1895Uw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Swabhiman programme,</a> a remarkable initiative that is not only transforming their lives but also serving as a model for empowering women through craft-based entrepreneurship. The women learn <em>Aari </em>work through Smile Foundation’s women-led training initiatives.</p>

<p>Smile Foundation recognised the need to equip these women with the tools, training, and market access to turn their craft skills into viable businesses.</p>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/@tjori/timeless-craft-of-stitch-aari-embroidery-dc1961176a57" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><em>Aari </em>embroidery</a> traces its origins back to the cobbler or ‘mochi’ communities of ancient Uttar Pradesh and Kutch. Interestingly, the <em>Aari </em>needles&nbsp;were primarily employed in the creation of shoes and soles.&nbsp;The decline of the ‘mocha’ trade&nbsp;compelled individuals to pivot towards the textile industry as a necessary means of sustaining their livelihoods. The Mughals, renowned for their openness to innovative techniques and artistic styles across various mediums, brought it to their royal courts. The skill gradually reached 18th-century Europe, where it was embraced as ‘Tambour’—named after the embroidery frame used.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-community-through-aari-work-craft"><strong>Building community through <em>Aari</em> work/craft</strong></h2>



<p>Smile’s centre is a space of solidarity where women come together to learn, share stories, encourage one another, and grow as a group. Some are forming small collectives. Others are looking for ways to start their own labels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the most notable features of the programme is its overall approach to empowerment. Beyond teaching technical skills or assisting with product development, the project also creating a sense of community, building confidence, and instilling the belief that these women can shape their own futures. There is camaraderie and mutual support among the programme participants. They share their challenges, celebrate successes, and inspire each other to push the limits of what’s possible.</p>



<p>The free-of-cost training programme in <em>Aari </em>embroidery and tailoring also introduces these women to the world of business planning, branding, and digital marketing—tools that once felt out of reach. With these skills, they are preparing to take on the marketplace, not just as workers, but as entrepreneurs.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-power-of-a-mentor"><strong>The power of a mentor</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most touching stories is that of Yashodha, a trainer who has become a role model. She gently guides her students through complex embroidery patterns. More importantly, they now discuss opening boutiques and taking customer orders with excitement. Several participants in the programme have learned to contribute to their household income.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The transformation doesn’t stop with learning. These women are encouraged to market their creations, participate in exhibitions, sell through digital platforms, and build local client networks. With knowledge of pricing, customer engagement, and digital tools, they are turning craft into a sustainable business model. The true beauty of this initiative lies in its ripple effect. Each empowered woman becomes a source of strength for many others, including her daughters, her neighbours, and her community.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-it-matters"><strong>Why it matters</strong></h2>



<p>In a world where millions of women still cannot get jobs, programmes like this show that women do well when they have the chance. Also, the focus on craft-based entrepreneurship aligns with a growing global trend that values handmade and artisanal goods. More and more, people want unique, ethically made things that tell the stories of their makers and reflect&nbsp;their skills.</p>



<p>This is what &#8216;handmade, heart-led&#8217; truly means. It’s about weaving lives back together with purpose and pride. Through its women-led training initiatives, <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/support-women-empowerment/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Smile Foundation</a> is helping craft more than products. It’s crafting futures. These creators, once invisible, are now being celebrated not only for their work, but for their artistry, heritage, and perseverance. What starts as a personal journey becomes a shared movement, bringing economic resilience to entire families and villages.</p>

<p>India, the world&#8217;s largest democracy and one of its fastest-growing economies, continues to struggle with closing the gender gap. The 2025 edition of the World Economic Forum&#8217;s <em><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-gender-gap-report-2025/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Global Gender Gap Report</a></em> spotlights a difficult reality. Despite incremental progress, India remains among the <strong>bottom five economies globally</strong> in gender parity in economic participation and opportunity. This should concern every policymaker, business leader, and citizen committed to inclusive development.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-india-at-a-glance-still-struggling-in-economic-and-political-empowerment"><strong>India at a glance: Still struggling in economic and political empowerment</strong></h2>



<p>According to the report, India scores <strong>40.7%</strong> on the Economic Participation and Opportunity subindex, barely ahead of countries like Egypt, Iran, and Pakistan. This indicates that Indian women still earn significantly less, are underrepresented in leadership roles, and participate in the workforce at far lower rates than men. Alarmingly:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Women&#8217;s <strong>estimated earned income</strong> is less than one-third of men&#8217;s.</li>



<li>Female representation in <strong>senior and managerial roles</strong> remains below 20%.</li>



<li>Women&#8217;s <strong>labour force participation</strong> is significantly below global averages.</li>
</ul>



<p>In political empowerment, the scenario is equally bleak. India, once a global beacon for electing female leaders, now sees minimal female ministerial representation and sluggish progress in parliamentary parity. The report highlights that only Bangladesh and Iceland have achieved parity in years served by a female head of state. India, despite its early progress, has stagnated.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/40.7-Bottom-5-globally-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14195" style="width:463px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/40.7-Bottom-5-globally-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/40.7-Bottom-5-globally-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/40.7-Bottom-5-globally-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/40.7-Bottom-5-globally-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/40.7-Bottom-5-globally.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-progress-in-education-and-health-but-gaps-remain"><strong>Progress in education and health but gaps remain</strong></h2>



<p>On a more positive note, India has closed over <strong>95% of its gender gap</strong> in Educational Attainment. Primary and secondary school enrolment has become nearly gender-equal, and more women than men now enrol in some streams of higher <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2639" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a>. However, this has not translated into proportional workforce outcomes, pointing to a broken pipeline between education and employment.</p>



<p>The <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2638" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Health</a> and Survival subindex shows moderate progress, but India still struggles with challenges like skewed sex ratios at birth and declining healthy life expectancy for women relative to men.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-holding-india-back"><strong>What is holding India back?</strong></h2>



<p>The report identifies several systemic issues:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Implementation gaps</strong>: While laws around gender equality exist, enforcement is weak.</li>



<li><strong>Cultural and social norms</strong>: Patriarchal structures, safety concerns, and domestic burdens continue to restrict women’s choices.</li>



<li><strong>Lack of supportive infrastructure</strong>: Poor access to childcare, flexible work policies, and safe transport are barriers to workforce participation.</li>



<li><strong>Industry segregation</strong>: Women remain overrepresented in low-wage, care-based sectors and underrepresented in high-growth industries like STEM and digital technologies.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-matters-for-india-s-economic-future"><strong>Why this matters for India’s economic future</strong></h2>



<p>The report reiterates that closing gender gaps means tapping into the full talent pool which could:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Boost India’s GDP by <strong>billions of dollars annually</strong>.</li>



<li>Improve resilience in times of crisis (as seen during COVID-19).</li>



<li>Spark innovation and improve business outcomes through diversity.</li>
</ul>



<p>At the current rate, <strong>economic parity will take 135 years</strong>, and <strong>political parity 162 years</strong>, globally. India risks falling further behind if urgent reforms are not initiated.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-recommendations-for-india"><strong>Recommendations for India</strong></h3>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Workforce re-entry and flexibility</strong>: Invest in returnship programmes, part-time work options, and employer-led care infrastructure to bring women back into the workforce.</li>



<li><strong>Representation matters</strong>: Quotas for women in political parties, local government, and corporate boards can create a pipeline of leaders.</li>



<li><strong>Incentivise employers</strong>: <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" title="Corporate Partnerships" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2640" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">CSR</a> and ESG-linked incentives for gender-equal hiring, leadership promotion, and pay equity.</li>



<li><strong>STEM and digital skilling</strong>: Scale up gender-targeted tech education and job placement schemes.</li>



<li><strong>Strengthen law enforcement</strong>: Ensure that laws on workplace safety, maternity benefits, and anti-discrimination are robustly implemented.</li>



<li><strong>Change the narrative</strong>: Public campaigns, community role models, and inclusive media can help shift deep-seated social norms.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smile-foundation-s-commitment-to-gender-empowerment"><strong>Smile Foundation’s commitment to gender empowerment</strong></h3>



<p>Smile Foundation has long recognised that empowering women and girls is foundational to building stronger communities. Through a multi-pronged approach, Smile works at the intersection of education, health, <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" title="Livelihood" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2637" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">skill development</a>, and leadership to advance gender equity across rural and urban India.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Girls’ education (Mission Education)</strong>: Smile ensures that girls from underserved communities have access to inclusive, quality education. through our <em><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/donation/support-girl-child" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">She Can Fly</a> </em>initiative. Thousands of girls across India receive not just classroom instruction but also life-skills training, nutrition, digital literacy, and career exposure.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/donation/women-empowerment" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Swabhiman</a> programme</strong>: This flagship women empowerment initiative focuses on adolescent girls and women from disadvantaged communities, offering training in reproductive health, financial literacy, self defense, and leadership. The programme also mobilises men and boys as allies through gender-sensitisation workshops.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/donation/livelihood" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Skill training and livelihoods (STeP)</a></strong>: Smile Foundation&#8217;s STeP initiative provides market-aligned skills training for young women, including digital and vocational skills, helping them secure dignified employment and break intergenerational cycles of poverty.</li>



<li><strong>Menstrual and maternal health</strong>: Through awareness camps and health interventions, Smile Foundation addresses taboo topics like menstrual hygiene and maternal nutrition enabling girls to stay in school and women to take control of their health.</li>
</ul>



<p>These programmes foster generational change, equipping women and girls to become agents of transformation within their families and communities.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-role-of-csr-and-civil-society-catalysts-for-change"><strong>Role of CSR and civil society: Catalysts for change</strong></h3>



<p>Smile Foundation is already piloting gender equity programmes at the grassroots. From skill training to girls&#8217; education and maternal health, our initiatives offer scalable models. But broader partnerships are essential.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-moment-for-bold-action"><strong>A moment for bold action</strong></h3>



<p>India’s ambition to become a global economic powerhouse cannot succeed without gender parity at its core. The <em>Global Gender Gap Report 2025</em> is a wake-up call. With a collective push from government, business, and civil society, India can not only improve its ranking but realise the full potential of its half a billion women.</p>

<p>In a village near Bangalore, <strong>Yajjiamma</strong> turned a domestic chore into a livelihood. “I have turned a simple habit into something more — a source of income, confidence and purpose,” she says. After joining Swabhiman’s entrepreneurship training last year, Yajjiamma began hygienically packaging and selling fresh paneer (“cottage cheese”) every other day. “Some people from nearby towns place regular orders. A local shop also buys from me,” she reports, and the extra income now pays for her son’s school books, letting her “save a little too”. Stories like hers are multiplying across rural India.</p>

<p>Nearby, <strong>Pavithra</strong> of Bangalore Rural had a similar transformation. “I grew up in a small village near Bangalore, where survival was all we knew… There was no room for dreams,” she recalls. With her husband’s encouragement, Pavithra tried Swabhiman’s training and “came across beekeeping. It seemed simple, but it felt right. Working with bees… gave me a sense of purpose.” Today she sells honey from her own hives, which “became a way for me to provide for my family and build something lasting.” For the first time, she felt she could create something of her own.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeqJGV3Fkrk3WBvF73PWZ4tgRaOA94P6uwmAIzh1Bw5YBm2kRzdEJHjF0pGg4f7KxsIKgyY2IAHfynRJHgpK5ig3ngboSF407H7Zh9_SeY-lRYYm4w-THnuTly3P1gifylpHPo4?key=Ougbja93JPAQ-HJbHSUfvA" alt=""/></figure>

<p>These personal accounts scoop up a broader trend: rural women are stepping into entrepreneurship at unprecedented rates. According to NITI Aayog’s latest data, women borrowers in India have surged with a <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/women-borrowers-up-22-since-2019-majority-from-semi-urban-rural-report-125030300782_1.html#:~:text=Women%20borrowers%20in%20India%20have,a%20report%20said%20on%20Monday" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">22% CAGR from 2019 to 2024</a>, and most of the new borrowers come from semi-urban and rural areas. In fact, as of December 2024 some 27 million Indian women are monitoring their credit scores, a sign of rising financial awareness that grew <a href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2107708#:~:text=NITI%20Aayog%20today%20launched%20the,report%20has%20been%20published%20by" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">42% over the previous year</a>. Importantly, women’s share of business loan applications has also climbed – reaching 35% of all business borrowers by late 2024 – though consumer loans (for personal needs) still dominate their borrowing. In sum, more rural women are seeking loans and <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2529" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> on finances than ever before.</p>



<p>Yet entrepreneurship remains a small share of the total. Women constitute only <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g0g5005ggo#:~:text=But%20the%20picture%20looks%20slightly,when%20it%20comes%20to%20entrepreneurship" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">about 14% of all entrepreneurs in India</a>, and they own roughly <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/over-50-of-indias-artisans-are-women-but-only-22-of-msmes-are-women-owned-economic-survey-2025/articleshow/117792414.cms?from=mdr#:~:text=%E2%80%9CCertain%20crafts%2C%20like%20embroidery%2C%20mat,respectively%2C%E2%80%9D%20it%20noted" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">22% of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs</a>) overall. The Economic Survey notes that women’s entrepreneurship falls off sharply with scale: women own 22% of micro-enterprises, but only 12% of small and 7% of medium firms. In rural areas the pattern is similar: most women-led businesses are micro-enterprises employing only family members or a handful of workers. Globally, India also lags. A World Bank analysis found female entrepreneurs account for less than a fifth of business owners in India, and female-led firms tend to employ more women than male-led ones.</p>



<p>Despite these gaps, the potential impact of rural women entrepreneurs is vast. The World Bank highlights that women-led enterprises in rural India already <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2024/11/21/giving-a-boost-to-rural-women-entrepreneurs#:~:text=,like%20marketing%2C%20technology%2C%20and%20advisory" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">employ an estimated 22–27 million people</a>. Supporting these growth-oriented, opportunity-driven enterprises (GOWEs) through tailored finance and services could dramatically expand rural jobs and reduce poverty. As one NITI report observes, encouraging women’s entrepreneurship “could create employment opportunities for 150 to 170 million people” while boosting overall economic growth. In other words, each village woman who starts a viable business can spark change far beyond her own home.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-systemic-barriers-towards-women-entrepreneurship"><strong>Systemic barriers towards women entrepreneurship</strong></h2>



<p>However, significant barriers still hold many rural women back.&nbsp;</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Access to credit</strong> is a perennial challenge. Banks often require collateral that most rural women lack, and financial products are rarely designed for tiny micro-enterprises. The NITI report notes persistent “credit aversion” and collateral issues for women, despite rising awareness. </li>
</ol>



<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Formal financial institutions tend to <strong>focus on larger loans</strong>, leaving rural entrepreneurs dependent on informal SHGs (self-help groups) or local lenders with limited capacity. In practice, even women with proven small businesses hit a ceiling; one Tamil Nadu vendor, <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2024/11/21/giving-a-boost-to-rural-women-entrepreneurs#:~:text=Subitha%20Banu%2C%20fondly%20known%20as,investment%20of%20about%20INR%201%2C00%2C000" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Bhai Amma</a>, made ₹700–800 a day selling biryani and eggs, but couldn’t find the ₹100,000 she needed to expand beyond her local lending group.</li>
</ol>



<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Skills and training gaps</strong> compound the problem. Many rural women have valuable craft or agricultural skills but limited business know-how. They may not know cost-pricing, bookkeeping, or marketing. A recent World Bank feature emphasizes that rural women often “miss critical business development services like marketing, technology, and advisory”. </li>
</ol>



<ol start="4" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Another analysis highlights that rural women entrepreneurs <strong>suffer from limited business skills, weak market access, and technology deficits</strong>, along with a shortage of mentors and networks. For example, Yajjiamma needed training on hygiene, pricing and communication before she could scale her paneer sales.</li>
</ol>



<ol start="5" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Infrastructure and markets</strong> are also weak in rural areas. Poor roads, unreliable power or internet, and lack of cold storage can make scaling a dairy or food enterprise nearly impossible. Local markets may pay low prices or remain closed to small producers. Women entrepreneurs often have to travel long distances on difficult terrain or depend on middlemen who take a large cut.</li>
</ol>



<ol start="6" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Finally, <strong>social norms and time poverty</strong> limit many women. Even with interest in business, women typically bear the bulk of household chores and childcare. As Pavithra recalls, her “days were filled with chores and working in the fields” and “there was no room for dreams” until she found the courage and support to try something new. In some villages, families may oppose women traveling alone or doing “men’s work.” </li>
</ol>



<ol start="7" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Lack of mentorship</strong> means many women feel isolated. One report notes that rural entrepreneurs often lack exposure and networking, unlike urban businesswomen.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-support-from-the-state-and-ngos-for-women-entrepreneurship"><strong>Support from the state and NGOs</strong> <strong>for women entrepreneurship</strong></h2>



<p>Recognising these issues, both government and civil society have launched numerous initiatives to help rural women entrepreneurs. The Government of India created the <strong>Women Entrepreneurship Platform (WEP)</strong> in 2017, an online ecosystem run by NITI Aayog. WEP aggregates information on funding, mentorship, incubators and skill training. Through partnerships it provides services in key areas like funding access, compliance assistance, mentoring and marketing for women entrepreneurs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other national schemes include <em>Stand Up India</em> (subsidised loans for women and SC/ST entrepreneurs), <em>Mudra Yojana</em> (collateral-free loans up to ₹10 lakh for new businesses, with 3–5 year tenures), <em>PMEGP</em> (subsidies to create micro-units), and targeted credit lines like <em>Mahila Samriddhi Yojana</em>. There are also industry-specific programmes (e.g. skill training for women artisans under the Mahila Coir Yojana).</p>



<p>At the state and local level, governments have set up incubators, startup grants, and women’s SHG federations to channel funding. For example, some states offer reserved industrial plots or reduced fees to women-owned enterprises. Broadly, policy efforts have raised awareness of credit access, launched entrepreneurship modules in rural livelihoods programmes, and created awards and capacity-building grants for women.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-swabhiman-approach"><strong>The Swabhiman approach</strong></h2>



<p>Development organisations and corporate CSR funds complement these schemes on the ground. Smile Foundation’s<strong> Swabhiman</strong> programme is a prime example. Launched in 2015 and now active in over 20 states, Swabhiman takes a <em>holistic</em> approach: it integrates <strong><a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2531" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a>, nutrition, skill training, and entrepreneurship development</strong> in villages. Our team organises village-level groups of women and girls for regular sessions. These include&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Nutrition education (teaching low-cost healthy recipes to combat anemia), </li>



<li>Health check-ups, </li>



<li>Life skills, and</li>



<li><a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/livelihood/" title="Livelihood" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2530" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Livelihood</a> training. </li>
</ul>



<p>Critically, Swabhiman runs <strong>Entrepreneurship Development Trainings</strong>: multi-day workshops led by experts that cover business basics, financial literacy, product development and marketing. Sarita Pradhan, who heads Swabhiman, notes that the programme “empowers marginalised women through nutrition, healthcare, and livelihood support” and uplifts them “through skill training [and] financial literacy”.</p>



<p>Since its inception, Swabhiman has reached thousands of villages and has <strong>benefited over half a million women and girls</strong> with its interventions. In one district alone, hundreds of women in Modgaon (Maharashtra) have completed Swabhiman’s training. They now help each other start cottage businesses or cooperatives. As Pradhan reports, women in remote Modgaon are learning to manage money and turn ideas into businesses – exploring ventures from small catering services to artisanal products. Elsewhere, Swabhiman groups have formed village savings clubs and even shared grain mills, multiplying their economic options.</p>



<p>Other NGOs and CSR initiatives follow similar models. For instance, ITC’s “Shakti” programme (corporate-sponsored) has enabled tens of thousands of rural women to sell FMCG products through rural retail networks. Microfinance organisations and NGOs like Self-Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) provide credit and training to women artisans and farmers. Tech nonprofits (e.g. Digital Green, Agri-fintech startups) are also piloting business training and market linkages in villages. The common thread is combining <strong>training</strong>, <strong>access to markets and finance</strong>, and <strong>community support</strong> – as seen in Swabhiman and other programmes – to turn latent skills into viable enterprises.</p>



<p><strong>Case studies: Beyond the expected</strong></p>



<p>The case studies above show how women are pursuing unconventional enterprises tailored to their local context. Yajjiamma’s dairy-based paneer business and Pavithra’s honey enterprise are far from Silicon Valley startups, but they are just as entrepreneurial in spirit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar stories abound: in Modgaon, for example, women have started roadside eateries serving locally-grown grains and vegetables, using recipes learned through Swabhiman’s nutrition workshops.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc-vn6e3wkMJ12HW2IXdl6RTn1rIYVrDYGKrKAHD5ZZXt2gQy4Zz1IxSKa6wnjI0Ok9gM6etJg66Jqhhq7LG4ud8clf0NSp2e8ytVvG2sHvjM4DnhzD1c8t8mCZMGQu-F2E89bM?key=Ougbja93JPAQ-HJbHSUfvA" alt=""/></figure>



<p><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Women and adolescent girls learning to prepare healthy dishes using locally available ingredients through a session led by a nutrition expert,&nbsp;</p>



<p>Others have revived traditional crafts: one beneficiary, Ranjana, launched a backyard poultry farm during the pandemic, supplementing her family’s income by selling eggs in neighboring villages (with advisory support from Swabhiman on feed and hygiene). Another cluster of villages trained villagers to dry and package local chilies and herbs, creating packaged foods sold in city markets.</p>



<p>These ventures challenge conventional definitions of entrepreneurship. They are often <strong>informal</strong> (many women cook or craft at home), <strong>small-scale</strong>, and <strong>community-rooted</strong>, yet they produce real economic value and empowerment. They show that an illiterate farmer’s wife can be an entrepreneur too, given the chance. As one development expert puts it, “recognising and supporting growth-oriented women’s enterprises can boost rural job creation, close gender gaps in entrepreneurship, and drive long-term economic growth”.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-recommendations-for-scaling-up"><strong>Recommendations for scaling up</strong></h2>



<p>Experts and experience point to concrete steps government, industry and NGOs can take to amplify this transformation:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Improve Access to Finance:</strong> Tailor credit products for rural women – for instance through collateral-free loans, group lending, or loan guarantees by governments or CSR funds. Training frontline bankers to understand women’s enterprises can help overcome “credit aversion” and paperwork hurdles. Expanding microfinance and linking village banks to national programmes would channel capital to women’s ventures at scale.<br></li>



<li><strong>Expand Training and Mentorship:</strong> Scale successful programmes like Swabhiman that provide practical business education. Bundling financial literacy, marketing skills and digital training is key. Establish mentoring networks or helplines so women entrepreneurs can get advice. As one report notes, “raising awareness, providing skill training, and improving access to government benefits” are cost-effective ways to empower women. Peer networks of rural entrepreneurs can also offer mutual support and collective bargaining power for inputs and sales.<br></li>



<li><strong>Build Market Linkages:</strong> Create more platforms that connect rural women producers to larger markets. CSR and private companies can source directly from women-led SHGs (as in ITC’s Shakti or KKV Karghewale initiatives). E-commerce tie-ups, rural fairs, and incubators that help women entrepreneurs brand and package goods will increase sales. Public procurement (for school lunches or uniforms) can earmark quotas for women’s groups.<br></li>



<li><strong>Leverage CSR and Public-Private Partnerships:</strong> Corporations should partner with NGOs to co-fund training and infrastructure (e.g. shared cold storage or solar power for village enterprises). CSR can sponsor joint projects linking entrepreneurship with health or education. Governments can incentivise such partnerships. For example, multi-stakeholder schemes could provide matching grants for CSR contributions to rural livelihood programmes.<br></li>



<li><strong>Address Social Barriers:</strong> Simultaneously run social campaigns that normalise women’s entrepreneurship. Community meetings should involve husbands and elders to win their support. Providing childcare or flexible training schedules can help women juggle family duties. Tackling issues like safety, transport and time poverty will free more women to participate.<br></li>
</ul>



<p>Implementing these measures in a coordinated way could have multiplier effects. The World Bank and NITI Aayog emphasise that <strong>integrated support structures and sector-specific programmes</strong> are essential for growth-oriented women entrepreneurs. Similarly, a government review stresses the need to streamline credit links, sensities bankers, and deliver efficient support mechanisms for rural women.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-breathe-more-life-into-these-local-entrepreneurs"><strong>Breathe more life into these local entrepreneurs</strong></h3>



<p>In summary, India is witnessing a quiet revolution in its villages. From paneer-making in Karnataka to honey-harvesting in Tamil Nadu and nutritious food stalls in Maharashtra, rural women are transforming their limited resources into enterprises that support their families and communities. These unconventional entrepreneurs – often invisible in official statistics – are beginning to reshape local economies. The success of initiatives like Swabhiman shows the power of targeted training and community networks. To ensure that Yajjiammas and Pavithras become the rule rather than the exception, stakeholders across society must double down on policies, investments and social support that build on this momentum. With sustained effort, rural women’s entrepreneurship can truly drive inclusive growth and change in India.</p>



<p>Smile Foundation’s Swabhiman initiative presents corporates with a meaningful opportunity to align their CSR efforts with inclusive, grassroots development. By combining vocational training tailored to local economies with financial and digital literacy, Swabhiman equips women to launch and sustain viable enterprises. The programme goes beyond skilling — it builds confidence, nurtures leadership, and strengthens market linkages, enabling women not just to earn, but to lead.</p>



<p>Through a <a href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">partnership with Smile Foundation</a>, companies can help catalyse real, measurable change — empowering women to rise, enabling families to thrive, and contributing towards resilient communities. Swabhiman isn’t asking companies to rescue women; it invites them to partner with communities already pushing against the limits of the possible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>India is on the cusp of a demographic and economic transformation, and one of the most powerful yet underleveraged forces in this shift is rural women entrepreneurs. From bustling cities to remote hamlets, grassroots women are no longer waiting for change, they are creating it. Despite facing formidable challenges, from financial exclusion and gender bias to infrastructural gaps and limited education, many women are forging new paths through women-led micro-enterprises.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-hard-won-road-to-economic-participation"><strong>The hard-won road to economic participation</strong></h2>



<p>The path to entrepreneurship for rural women is strewn with hurdles. Cultural barriers, low digital literacy, and restricted mobility often prevent them from entering or scaling the market. According to a 2024 study by the Bhartiya Yuva Shakti Trust (BYST), over 44% of women entrepreneurs in India <a href="https://government.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/only-13-women-grassroot-entrepreneurs-on-e-commerce-networks-44-use-digital-payment-apps-survey/109028543" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">struggle to sustain their businesses</a> compared to 36% of men. Only 13% have a presence on e-commerce platforms, and less than half use digital payment systems. Meanwhile, of the 63 million MSMEs in India, only 20% are owned by women.</p>

<p>This disparity should concern a country with ambitious gender parity goals. Active female participation in the economy, particularly in underserved rural regions, is essential not only for equity but also for national productivity. However, low financial confidence and limited social support leave many women isolated, without the tools or trust needed to succeed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-power-of-women-led-collective-micro-enterprises"><strong>The power of women-led collective micro-enterprises</strong></h2>



<p>One proven strategy to overcome these hurdles is collective enterprise. Self-help groups (SHGs) and co-owned business models allow women to share risks, gain confidence, and pool resources. These structures also offer community validation, which is vital in societies where gender roles are rigid.</p>



<p>However, disparities persist even within these collectives. Gender segmentation in business types remains stark. Women are often nudged toward low-margin, low-growth sectors like handicrafts or food processing. There is a pressing need to open male-dominated sectors to women while also elevating the visibility and profitability of female-dominated fields.</p>

<li><strong>Cultural Stigma:</strong> Traditional gender roles, family resistance, and social conservatism still deter many women from pursuing business activities.</li>



<li><strong>Financial Exclusion:</strong> Banks often require collateral that rural women cannot provide. Financial products rarely cater to micro-enterprises run by women.</li>



<li><strong>Knowledge Gaps:</strong> Many women lack formal <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2533" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> or business training. They may be skilled artisans or farmers but have no exposure to cost-pricing, branding, or customer service.</li>



<li><strong>Infrastructure Deficits:</strong> Inadequate roads, power outages, and limited digital connectivity hinder scale-up efforts. Poor local markets force women to rely on intermediaries, eroding profit margins.</li>



<li><strong>Time Poverty:</strong> With the burden of household responsibilities disproportionately falling on women, the time available for business pursuits remains minimal.</li>
</ul>



<p>Addressing these barriers calls for a nuanced, multilayered approach that combines policy incentives, grassroots engagement, and corporate participation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exemplars-of-grit-and-innovation"><strong>Exemplars of grit and innovation</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Chetna Sinha</strong>, founder of the Mann Deshi Bank and Foundation, epitomises resilience. After her application to start a rural women’s bank was rejected due to the literacy levels of promoting members, she returned to her village to conduct literacy classes. Five months later, she reapplied and succeeded. Today, Mann Deshi Bank has over 100,000 account holders and has disbursed loans worth over ₹780 million. It offers customised products for rural micro-entrepreneurs and delivers training tailored to their evolving needs.</p>



<p><strong>Bina Devi</strong>, the 'Mushroom Lady' of Bihar, began mushroom farming beneath her bed due to space constraints. Today, she has trained over 1,500 women across 100 villages in Munger district, democratising access to this high-nutrition, high-value crop. Her work earned her the Nari Shakti Samman from President Ram Nath Kovind.</p>



<p><strong>Kanika Talikdar</strong>, a 27-year-old widow from Assam, turned adversity into opportunity by launching Jay Vermi Compost with just ₹500 and 1 kg of earthworms. Today, her organic compost is sold on Amazon and Flipkart, and she earns a monthly revenue of ₹3.5 lakh.</p>



<p><strong>Pabiben Rabari</strong>, an artisan from Kutch, invented the "Hari Jari" embroidery technique to adapt to changing norms while preserving cultural aesthetics. Her enterprise, Pabiben.com, now supports over 300 women artisans and has taken her products to Bollywood and Hollywood.</p>



<p>These stories highlight both personal triumphs and also systemic cracks that, if bridged, could lead to large-scale economic inclusion.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-policy-landscape-foundations-and-fault-lines"><strong>The policy landscape: Foundations and fault lines</strong></h3>



<p>Several government schemes aim to promote women’s entrepreneurship:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Stand-Up India Scheme:</strong> Offers loans from ₹10 lakh to ₹1 crore to women setting up greenfield enterprises.</li>



<li><strong>PM MUDRA Yojana:</strong> Provides collateral-free loans up to ₹10 lakh.</li>



<li><strong>PM Employment Generation Programme:</strong> Offers higher subsidies to women applicants.</li>
</ul>



<p>Many women are unaware of these schemes, and financial institutions still exhibit implicit biases. Effective implementation hinges on last-mile connectivity, community mobilisation, and continuous mentorship.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-strategies-for-systemic-scale-up"><strong>Strategies for systemic scale-up</strong></h3>



<p>To harness the potential of grassroots women entrepreneurs, a coordinated, multi-stakeholder approach is essential:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Tailor Financial Products:</strong> Develop collateral-free, low-interest credit lines. Train bankers to assess non-traditional enterprises.</li>



<li><strong>Build Market Access:</strong> Create rural-to-urban market bridges via online platforms, cooperatives, and <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/corporate-partnership/" title="Corporate Partnerships" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2534" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">CSR</a> linkages.</li>



<li><strong>Promote Inclusive Incubation:</strong> Rural incubators and startup bootcamps should offer business mentorship and marketing training specifically for women.</li>



<li><strong>Mobilize CSR:</strong> Encourage corporate partners to co-invest in community-based entrepreneurship models. Programmes like ITC Shakti and Swabhiman demonstrate the power of CSR in grassroots development.</li>



<li><strong>Break Stereotypes:</strong> Conduct social campaigns that challenge gender roles and promote success stories. Engage male family members as allies.</li>



<li><strong>Invest in Infrastructure:</strong> Cold storage, transport, and reliable internet access are crucial for scaling.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-way-forward"><strong>The way forward</strong></h3>



<p>India’s economic narrative cannot remain incomplete by side lining half its population. The grassroots women entrepreneurs profiled here are not outliers; they are flesh and blood of what’s possible. </p>



<p>Investing in rural women’s entrepreneurship yields exponential returns—not just in GDP, but in societal wellbeing. As these women take control of their economic destinies, they uplift entire communities. The challenge is to turn isolated successes into structural shifts. Doing so will not only close the gender gap in entrepreneurship but also craft a more equitable, resilient India.</p>

<p>Through small, consistent changes in daily habits, rural women are addressing malnutrition, improving family health, fostering a culture of well-being, and building healthier homes. This transformation is not the result of sweeping reforms but of grassroots initiatives that empower women with knowledge, resources, and a supportive community.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The nutritional landscape</strong></h2>



<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), children should regularly consume at least four out of seven recommended food groups to ensure proper nutrition. These groups include grains, legumes, dairy, flesh foods, eggs, vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables, and other fruits and vegetables. However, recent statistics reveal that about 77% of children aged between six and twenty-three months do not meet this dietary recommendation.</p>



<p>Globally, undernutrition is associated with 45% of child deaths, and in 2022, 149 million children under five were estimated to be stunted, 45 million wasted, and 37 million overweight or obese .(<a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/infant-and-young-child-feeding?utm_source=chatgpt.com" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">World Health Organization</a>)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Empowering women through community support</strong></h2>



<p>In rural areas, women often face isolation due to limited access to resources, transportation, and educational opportunities. Traditional roles have confined them to domestic responsibilities, restricting their exposure to <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1455" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> education and personal growth. However, shared experiences and challenges have become a foundation for unity. Through community support, women are finding strength, confidence, and knowledge.</p>



<p>Smile Foundation&#8217;s <a href="https://donate.smilefoundationindia.org/women-empowerment/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow"><strong>Swabhiman</strong></a> programme exemplifies this approach. Launched in 2005, Swabhiman reaches out to marginalised and socially excluded women, educating them through two models:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Nutrition, healthcare, and reproductive health</li>



<li>Digital literacy and entrepreneurship. </li>
</ol>



<p>In its first model, through community practices, over 190,000 women have been impacted, and more than 76,000 women sensitised on reproductive and child health.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Promoting nutrition and well-being: Building healthier homes</strong></h2>



<p>Nutrition is not solely about food. It&#8217;s about awareness, access, and informed choices. While traditional knowledge passed down through generations holds value, evolving health challenges necessitate updated practices. Grassroots initiatives are educating rural women on balanced diets, hygiene, child feeding practices, and maternal health.</p>



<p>In 2024, Smile Foundation provided nutrition enhancement support to over 32,000 women and children through more than 1,000 peer educators, community health volunteers, and change agents. The programme focuses on creating awareness, sharing knowledge, and strengthening physical infrastructure and government initiatives to ensure vulnerable populations have access to adequate and nutritious food.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Leading change through everyday practices</strong></h3>



<p>Change often begins in the kitchen. Incorporating locally available vegetables and fruits, iron-rich foods, and maintaining hygiene are small yet impactful steps. When one woman adopts a new habit and shares it with others, it sparks a cycle of learning and leadership. Communities evolve through the lived experiences of their members, with each healthy habit becoming a building block for a better future.</p>



<p>Smile Foundation supports this by helping women establish community and individual kitchen gardens, ensuring access to high-quality seasonal vegetables. Inter-village recipe contests showcase how healthy meals can be prepared using affordable local ingredients, promoting practical nutrition among villagers .</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Educating the next generation for healthier homes</strong></h3>



<p>Building healthier homes extends to educating the next generation. When children observe their mothers making informed decisions, participating in community programmes, or growing their own food, they learn the value of independence and knowledge. This creates a cycle of empowerment, where each generation builds on the strength of the one before.</p>



<p>By investing in the health and <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2460" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> of their children, rural women are also investing in the future of their communities. A healthy child grows into a productive adult, and a well-informed youth becomes a change-maker.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Challenges in building healthier homes</strong></h2>



<p>Despite progress, rural women still face significant challenges:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Cultural and gender norms</strong>: Deep-rooted gender norms often limit women&#8217;s roles to caregiving, restricting their decision-making power.</li>



<li><strong>Workload and time poverty</strong>: Balancing multiple roles leaves women with little time or energy to focus on their well-being or learn new practices.</li>



<li><strong>Financial constraints</strong>: Limited financial resources make it difficult to afford healthy foods, hygienic products, and healthcare services.</li>



<li><strong>Limited access to health education</strong>: Many women have had limited schooling, and public health messages often fail to reach them effectively.</li>



<li><strong>Poor health infrastructure</strong>: Underdeveloped healthcare systems and long distances to clinics prevent timely access to care.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Steps taken to overcome the challenges</strong></h3>



<p>Collaborative efforts between the government and development organisations are addressing these challenges. Our initiatives include refurbishing Anganwadi centres, conducting competency strengthening workshops for workers, establishing kitchen gardens, and conducting knowledge-building sessions for women.</p>



<p>In the year 2023-24, Smile Foundation sensitised over 75,000 people on health hygiene through Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) activities, and more than 80,000 people benefited from telemedicine projects. Overall, more than 1.05 million individuals—75% of them women and children—have benefited from our health programmes.</p>



<p>Leading healthier lives by building healthier homes is a challenging endeavor for rural women. However, through small, everyday actions and the support of community initiatives, they are driving significant change. Empowering women with the right tools, knowledge, and resources has the potential to uplift not only their families but entire communities.</p>



<p>As we reflect on these efforts, it&#8217;s clear that the path to healthier homes and communities lies in empowering the women at their heart.</p>

<p>India’s remarkable strides in maternal care and infant health paint a hopeful picture. The <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2112476" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Maternal</a><a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2112476" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"> </a><a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2112476" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Mortality Ratio</a> (MMR) has fallen from 130 to 97 per 100,000 live births. Neonatal and infant mortality rates have also dropped significantly—by 65% and 69% respectively—surpassing global averages. Yet behind these promising statistics lies a sobering reality of India&#8217;s rural maternal care system.</p>



<p>Each number represents a mother—often rural, frequently impoverished, and too often unheard. Her journey through pregnancy and childbirth is far more than a biological event.  Such scenarios reflect that we are going through a test of strength of our maternal care system in rural India, the equity of our social structures, and the depth of our collective compassion, and we have a long way to go.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rituals of care – More than cultural symbols</strong></h2>



<p>In rural India, baby showers, known by various names like <em>Godh Bharai, Seemantham, Shaad, or Dohale Jevan</em>, are threads in a communal safety net. These traditions embody emotional, spiritual, and nutritional support for the expectant mother.</p>



<p>In North India’s <em>Godh Bharai</em>, blessings, music, and festive meals offer joy and reassurance. South India’s <em>Seemantham</em> celebrates the mother with bangles believed to emit vibrations that calm the unborn child. In Eastern and Western regions, food, music, and community love are central to ceremonies like <em>Shaad</em> and <em>Dohale Jevan</em>.</p>



<p>Beyond their spiritual richness, these events reduce maternal stress, reinforce support networks, and provide emotional grounding—essentials for a safe pregnancy. The shared wisdom from older women, nourishing foods, and joyful celebrations help prepare her mentally and physically for childbirth and motherhood. Such ceremonies also mark a shift in the mother’s role, affirming her importance and care within the family. </p>



<p>This emotional reassurance, combined with social and nutritional support, contributes to better maternal <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1453" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a> and can positively impact the baby’s development. In essence, these age-old customs are deeply rooted systems of community care that foster resilience, wellbeing, and healthy beginnings.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The gaps in rural maternal healthcare</strong></h3>



<p>India’s efforts to improve maternal health have yielded significant progress. Since 1990, the country has witnessed an <a href="https://mohfw.gov.in/?q=pressreleasetb-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">83% decline in its Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)</a>, a testament to national policy interventions and improved service delivery under frameworks like the National Health Mission. However, behind these promising statistics lies a more complex and uneven reality—particularly in rural India.</p>



<p>Critical complications such as excessive bleeding (postpartum haemorrhage), sepsis, pregnancy-induced hypertension, obstructed labour, and unsafe abortions continue to claim the lives of countless women, especially those in underserved regions. The persistence of these largely preventable causes underscores that while healthcare systems have expanded, their reach, reliability, and equity remain insufficient.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Awareness: What she doesn’t know can hurt her</strong></h3>



<p>Lack of awareness remains a major barrier to accessing maternal healthcare in India. Many women are unaware of the importance of antenatal check-ups (ANC), resulting in missed opportunities for early detection of complications. Among currently pregnant women, only 30% had three or more ANC visits, while 27% had none. Even among lactating women, 18% reported zero ANC visits. In Punjab, NFHS-4 data shows just 67.8% of women received four ANC visits. These figures underline the urgent need for targeted awareness campaigns to promote consistent, informed engagement with maternal and child health services.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Affordability: Confronting the cost of survival</strong></h3>



<p>For many rural families, maternal health is a financial compromise. The inability to afford nutritious food, travel for medical check-ups, or private consultations leads to delayed care and preventable complications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore<strong>, </strong>women delay antenatal check-ups or give birth at home, not by choice—but because they simply cannot afford the journey to a clinic, the tests, or even a nutritious meal. With no financial cushion, families often choose between food and healthcare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The absence of affordable iron supplements, fresh vegetables, or hygiene essentials leaves mothers dangerously malnourished and anemic. The result is a cycle of poor maternal outcomes passed down across generations because health becomes a luxury only few can buy.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Accessibility: When care is far, risks grow near</strong></h3>



<p>In rural India, many expectant mothers face the harsh reality of travelling several kilometres—often on unpaved roads or via scarce public transport—to access even basic healthcare. These delays can prove fatal, especially during labour or pregnancy-related emergencies. The absence of reliable transport systems and referral mechanisms further compounds the risk. Sub-centres and primary health centres, intended as frontline providers of maternal care, are frequently understaffed, under-equipped, or entirely non-existent. Without skilled birth attendants and timely access to essential medicines and diagnostic tools, treatable complications like haemorrhage, eclampsia, and infections become deadly. The distance to care becomes a life-threatening gap.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Availability: Geography and broken systems block the path to care</strong></h3>



<p>A mother in a remote village may walk miles for a blood pressure check, or worse, never go at all. Healthcare is often distant and sporadic, with clinics understaffed or unreachable. Mobile medical vans are rare, and even when available, they may not return soon enough. Anganwadi workers, often the only hope for health <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2457" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a>, are stretched thin.</p>



<p>The lack of timely screenings or follow-ups can turn a manageable condition into a fatal one. For these women, distance and delay can be the difference between life and death.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Intersecting Inequities</strong></h3>



<p>These three barriers do not operate in isolation. Rather, their intersection deepens existing socio-economic divides. Data consistently shows that <a href="https://www.prb.org/resources/maternal-care-in-india-reveals-gaps-between-urban-and-rural-rich-and-poor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">utilisation of maternal healthcare services</a>—both antenatal and postnatal—varies sharply based on income, caste, education, and geography. Women from lower-income or marginalised communities are significantly less likely to receive skilled care during childbirth, contributing to disproportionate maternal health outcomes.</p>



<p>Moreover, the absence of skilled healthcare workers at the time of delivery remains a persistent challenge. Without trained personnel to guide safe births and manage complications, the goal of ensuring every mother a safe pregnancy remains unmet in large parts of the country. In sum, the journey towards maternal health equity in rural India requires more than infrastructure—it demands a transformation of systems, mindsets, and investments that address the <strong>availability, accessibility, and affordability</strong> of care for every woman.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Community care in action with Swabhiman</strong></h2>

<p>Sustainable change in maternal and child health initiatives begins with effective collaboration among key stakeholders. Regular interface meetings are held with Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI) members, government officials, and representatives from various sectors such as education, health, and local governance.</p>



<p><strong>Key Initiatives and Community Involvement</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Community Kitchen Gardens:<br></strong>To improve nutritional intake, 22 community kitchen gardens were established, providing beneficiaries with locally grown vegetables such as bottle gourd, tomatoes, and pumpkins.<br></li>



<li><strong>Observing Special Days:<br></strong>Key health and nutrition-related days such as Women’s Day, Breastfeeding Week ,and POSHAN MAH  were observed with awareness campaigns, screening camps, recipe competitions, and educational sessions. These events aimed to educate women and caregivers on proper nutrition and maternal care practices.<br></li>



<li><strong>Breastfeeding Awareness Week:<br></strong>In partnership with ICDS and the PepsiCo Foundation, Smile Foundation organised breastfeeding demonstrations, emphasising the benefits of proper attachment and positioning. Awareness sessions educated caregivers on the importance of breastfeeding for both mother and child.<br></li>



<li><strong>Godh bharai and Annaprashan Diwas:<br></strong>Monthly events focused on maternal and child nutrition included Godh bharai for pregnant women, offering nutritional support and education, and Annaprashan for children starting complementary feeding. These celebrations provide vital community support and promote behaviour change in nutrition practices.<br></li>



<li><strong>POSHAN MAH Celebrations:<br></strong>Smile Foundation, along with ICDS and Education departments, organised nutrition recipe competitions, school-level activities, and kitchen garden initiatives during POSHAN MAH, enhancing community involvement and nutrition awareness.</li>
</ol>



<p>Through these initiatives, stakeholder collaboration and community participation continue to drive positive outcomes in maternal and child health.</p>



<p><strong>Nutrition is grown, served, and shared</strong></p>



<p>Nutrition and maternal care are not just delivered — they are cultivated, practised, and celebrated within the community. Nutrition is grown in kitchen gardens, served through local recipes, and shared via counselling, health camps, and regular screenings — ensuring year-round wellbeing for mothers and children.</p>



<p><strong>Growing nutrition inside homes</strong></p>



<p>132 kitchen gardens were set up at Anganwadi centres and homes, including 3 community gardens, using distributed winter vegetable seeds. This ensured access to fresh produce for daily use and nutrition events. The Education Department expanded the model to 21 schools through district and NRLM support.</p>



<p><strong>Learning through recipes<br></strong>Inter-village recipe contests engaged 151 women and caregivers, showcasing healthy, affordable dishes using local ingredients. Judged by officials, the contests promoted practical nutrition and honoured winners at the district level.</p>



<p><strong>Counselling and Follow-Up<br></strong>Regular follow-ups were conducted for anaemic and malnourished women, with ASHAs, Anganwadi workers, and community staff offering focused counselling and timely referrals to strengthen maternal health outcomes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>PARTNER FOR COMMUNITY-LED TRANSFORMATION</strong></h3>



<p>Maternal care in India is at a pivotal moment. While national data reflects progress, the ground reality in rural areas demands deeper, more inclusive interventions. It is not merely about improving statistics but transforming lives.</p>



<p>The Swabhiman programme offers a blueprint for community-led, sustainable maternal health solutions. Its success is rooted in collective action—from mothers and caregivers to local officials and frontline workers.</p>



<p>CSR partnerships have the potential to amplify this impact manifold. By aligning business resources with community health goals, companies can co-create meaningful change—ensuring a robust maternal care in across India, including the remotest corners because every mother receives the care, dignity, and support she deserves.</p>

<p>To build a prosperous society, we must ensure that every citizen has equal access to opportunities and is treated at par with each other. This is why gender equality is extremely important for any society. However, as we have seen, despite rapid economic and technological growth in the past decades, there is still a lot of gender disparity in countries around the world, and in India. Governments around the world have been trying to tackle this problem in many ways, and gender budgeting is one of the tools that they use.</p>



<p>Simply put, gender budgeting means analysing the government budget through a gender lens to ensure that policies and initiatives carried out by the government are benefiting everyone equally, especially those who have been historically discriminated against because of their gender identity. In India, gender budgeting has gained momentum over the years, with its share in total expenditure rising from 4.5% in 2014 to 6.8% in FY25, <a href="https://www.clearias.com/gender-budgeting/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">as highlighted in this report</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Understanding gender budgeting</strong></h2>



<p>As mentioned above, gender budgeting is a tool or a perspective integrated into the budgeting process to ensure gender-specific impact of government initiatives. While it may be misunderstood as something where a separate budget is created to achieve gender equality and to invest in policies that help in achieving that, it is not about that. It is actually about bringing gender considerations in the centre while entire budget planning.</p>



<p>The roots of it can be traced back to the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995 after which the idea started becoming more mainstream. Many countries, including India, have since then adopted this method to move towards creating a more inclusive budget. Gender budgeting can help in many ways. Here are some of the examples:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Promoting gender equality –</strong> One of the most important functions of gender budgeting is to use public spending in a way that it supports marginalized genders. The resources are allocated to promote gender equality and bridge the many gaps that exist in our current system.</li>



<li><strong>Economic growth –</strong> While it may seem like gender budgeting only helps a particular gender, it is not true. By bridging the gap between genders and providing them equal opportunity, it allows them to increase their participation in the labour force and, in turn, support overall economic growth of the country.</li>



<li><strong>Empowerment of women –</strong> By investing in initiatives like women’s education, <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/health/" title="Health" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="1431" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">health</a>, etc., the governments can create an opportunity where women can be empowered. It helps in the improvement of their participation in society, financial independence, better health, and much more.</li>



<li><strong>Dealing with gender-based violence &#8211; G</strong>ender budgeting can allocate resources to programmes that prevent and address gender-based violence, such as domestic violence shelters, legal aid services, and awareness campaigns. These initiatives create safer environments for women and promote social cohesion.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gender budgeting in India</strong></h2>



<p>Now, let us look at how India has been using <a href="https://vajiramandravi.com/upsc-daily-current-affairs/mains-articles/gender-budgeting-in-india/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">gender budgeting as a robust policy tool</a> to get all the benefits mentioned above. The concept was first introduced in India in the budget 2005-06 and since then, every year, the government publishes a Gender Budget Statement (GBS) which highlights the allocations made by the government for women-specific schemes.</p>



<p>We can understand the gender budgeting initiative in India by looking at in from three perspectives:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Women-specific schemes –</strong> <strong> </strong>These schemes have 100% allocation for women and address their specific needs. Examples include the <em>Beti Bachao Beti Padhao</em> (Save the Girl Child, Educate the Girl Child) campaign and the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY), which provides financial assistance to pregnant and lactating mothers.</li>



<li><strong>Allocation for women within general schemes –</strong> These schemes allocate at least 30 per cent of their budget for women. For Example, MGNREGA promotes women’s participation in the workforce and National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) has specific budget allocation for maternal and child health.</li>



<li><strong>Gender budgeting cells – </strong>The government has established GBCs in various ministries and departments to institutionalize gender budgeting. These cells are responsible for analyzing budgets from a gender perspective and ensuring that gender considerations are integrated into policy and programme design.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Impact of gender budgeting in India</strong></h2>



<p>While we have already looked at how gender budgeting impacts not just women but the overall economy, let us quickly see how it benefits a rapidly growing country like India. First of all, investment in women’s <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/education/" title="Education" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked" data-wpil-monitor-id="2434" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">education</a> initiatives have improved their literacy level and also enrolment of girls in schools. At the same time, a special focus has been given to women’s health initiatives and it has helped those living in villages and remote areas, especially pregnant women. Women’s participation in the labour force has also been improving steadily because of these initiatives and they have also received various social protections under different schemes. Overall, gender budgeting has created a safety net for women in India who have historically faced discrimination because of their gender.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Challenges and way forward</strong></h2>



<p>While we have talked about the positive impact of gender budgeting, we must also look at the many challenges that exist today and what we can do in the future to overcome these challenges.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>First of all, there is still a lack of awareness among the policymakers, administrators and general public. Those who are responsible for the implementation of these schemes in the remotest areas are often biased. Therefore, we need to invest heavily in capacity building programmes to ensure everyone is aware of their rights and duties in this area.</li>



<li>Secondly, while India has adopted gender budgeting for years, there is still a shortage of data to meaningfully assess the impact of these initiatives. In the absence of data, it cannot be ascertained what is happening right and what needs to improve.</li>



<li>Thirdly, there is a lack of such initiatives in all the ministries, and it is only focused in some specific ministries like women and child development, rural development, and health and family welfare. The core idea of gender budgeting is to analyse the entire budget through a gender perspective, and it is important that all the ministries start adopting that perspective.</li>
</ol>



<p>Therefore, as we move forward, India needs to deal with these challenges proactively and establish strong monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to ensure that the initiatives do not just remain on paper.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Gender budgeting initiatives are a powerful tool for promoting gender equality and empowering women. By integrating gender perspectives into the budgeting process, governments can address systemic inequalities and create a more inclusive society. In India, gender budgeting has made significant strides in improving education, healthcare, employment, and social protection for women. However, there is still much work to be done to strengthen its implementation and expand its reach. Therefore, in future, India needs to focus on prioritizing spreading awareness, capacity building, establishing monitoring and evaluation systems, and improving data collection to make these initiatives stronger.</p>
