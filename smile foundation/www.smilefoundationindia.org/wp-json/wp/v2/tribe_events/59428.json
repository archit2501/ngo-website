Specialized services like eye check-up, identifying cataract patients and referring them to hospitals, distribution of spectacles after eye check-up, dental care, pathological and gynecological services and orthopedic services were provided to the people. Most of the people treated were daily wage laborers, women who worked as maids, children and aged people who were also made aware of various ways on how to eat healthy and inculcate healthy habits to keep diseases at bay.<\/p>\n<p>Smile on Wheels programme at present has 34 operational projects in 265 remote villages and urban slums across India, directly benefitting over 400,000 lives in a year.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>People living in slums and rural areas are often prone to many communicable as well as curable diseases which in later stages become life threatening due to the lack of [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":59429,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"_tribe_events_status":"","_tribe_events_status_reason":"","footnotes":""},"tags":[],"tribe_events_cat":[53],"class_list":["post-59428","tribe_events","type-tribe_events","status-publish","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","tribe_events_cat-health-and-awareness-activities-for-underprivileged-children-families","cat_health-and-awareness-activities-for-underprivileged-children-families"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v24.4 -
