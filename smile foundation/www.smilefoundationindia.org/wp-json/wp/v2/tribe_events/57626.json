The workshop addressed several issues that adolescents face and also included hands-on, experiential exercises on identity formation and confusion, sexual developments in the body, sexual safety, personal choice and consent etc. The training was started with the introduction and after that an energizing activity was conducted in which some general questions were asked and students replied to those questions with much enthusiasm. A question-answer round and chart paper activity was conducted. Two movies were screened later on regarding Menstruation Hygiene and the other on Sexual Abuse and Role of Child. The trainer also spoke about topics such as the changes that take place during puberty, women and child safety, Menstruation Cycle and its importance for girls etc.<\/p>\n<p class=\"partnertext\" align=\"justify\">After the completion of the project the women shared how the workshop was very helpful in clearing a lot of doubts regarding their personal health and wellness.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A one day life skill session was held on the 12th Dec 2015 with the 35 girls under Shinnyo-En on Relationships, Intimacy and Sexuality Education.
