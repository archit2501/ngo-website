Career Counseling helps students connect to experts who have enough life experiences to share. They are role models who have accomplished much, and helped people in their life. This is why Career Counseling can serve as an inspiration to those who require it.<\/p>\n<p>Child for Child programme of Smile Foundation conducted a career counseling session for children from privileged schools. Dr. Ali Khwaja, who is Founder and the Principal Faculty at Banjara Academy, Bangalore was the keynote speaker for the session. Dr. Khwaja is has been counselling students, parents &amp; teachers in different aspects like Cyber Safety Awareness, Career Counseling, Anger Management and many relevant fields that have become even more vital in current Covidian times.<\/p>\n<p>For the session, after registering on Paytm Insider the online webinar zoom link is sent immediately via an email over the registered email address and via sms to the registered mobile number.
