A vegetable gardening workshop was organized by a Mission Education centre in Karnataka for the children to teach them the basics of vegetable gardening at home and also create awareness about the benefits of consuming home grown vegetables. A demo was organized in which children also actively participated and joined in mixing the compost along with employees from TURNER who had also joined in the activity. Sapling and seeds of lettuce, coriander, basil, and greens were planted. The employees distributed pizzas for all the children and interacted with them.<\/p>\n<p>Mission Education is a national level programme of Smile Foundation, which is committed to providing basic education and healthcare to underprivileged children.<\/p>\n<p>Smile Foundation is an NGO in India directly benefitting over 600,000 children and their families every year, through more than 250 live welfare projects on education, healthcare, livelihood and women empowerment, in over 950 remote villages and slums across 25 states of India.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It is very important to teach children the importance of eating vegetables and fruits from a very early age for their growth and development into healthy individuals.
