And as many as 41% are not fully comfortable following COVID protocol in school.<\/p>\n<p>These details have emerged in a survey by Smile Foundation where the major respondents are the school children. This survey was conducted between February and March 2021 among a random sample from 26,860 students from 131 schools across 12 states, among students in the 8-18 age group.<\/p>\n<p>The survey was conducted among beneficiary students of Smile Foundation&#8217;s flagship Mission Education program, which aims to provide basic education and healthcare to underprivileged children.<\/p>\n<p>The survey has found that an overwhelming 78% students are happy about the prospect of reopening of schools, but 22% students are anxious and scared of meeting their school friends and interacting with them.<\/p>\n<p>Worryingly, as many as 52% students were found to be concerned about consuming mid-day meals when schools reopen.<\/p>\n<p>59% of the students surveyed in Smile Foundation&#8217;s study were from rural areas, 25% were from urban areas, and 16% were from semi-urban areas.<\/p>\n<p>The pandemic has fundamentally reshaped education delivery with students opting for blended learning options. As many as 49% of the students surveyed opted for a blend of online learning tools and offline education delivery. Through the pandemic, Smile Foundation has implemented a blended learning approach under its <strong>Shiksha Na Ruke<\/strong> initiative to ensure continued education of school children to mitigate disruption from COVID-19.<\/p>\n<p>Smile Foundation\u2019s blended learning approach improves accessibility to education for students across India through multiple means \u2013 smartphones, tablets, television sets, radio and even through feature phones. Home visits by teachers, cluster classes, distribution of printed worksheets, guidance by mentors and Shikshamitras, all form part of the blended learning approach, which includes methodology for continued learning, even after schools gradually re-open.<\/p>\n<p>Talking about the survey, <strong>Mr. Santanu Mishra, Co-Founder, and Executive Trustee, Smile Foundation<\/strong> said, \u201cIt is important to understand the ground reality and the concerns of the children and their parents. Before schools reopen, we must work on educating students about COVID-appropriate behavior in these new normal circumstances. Over the past year, students have been learning through a combination of various online and offline modes. However there has certainly been a significant gap in learning. Considerable time and effort must be devoted to build students&#8217; confidence in returning to schools.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The survey also included responses from 75 teachers in 12 states. It found that 69% teachers were highly satisfied with the teaching and learning process in the blended learning format to reach the children and continue the teaching learning\u2026 an attempt to Shiksha Na Ruke.<\/p>\n<p>The survey suggested that 44% teachers feel students will not be able to catch up with learning as per the conventional grades\u2019 standard when they return to schools, while 42% of teachers felt maintaining COVID protocol will be the other major challenge for returning students.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Mission Education<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Under its flagship program, Mission Education, Smile Foundation is committed to provide basic education and\u00a0healthcare to underprivileged children.
