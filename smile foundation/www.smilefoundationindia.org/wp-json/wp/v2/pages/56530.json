Governments should ensure that children survive and develop healthily.\n<\/br><\/br>\nArticle 7\n<\/br>\nAll children have the right to a legally registered name, and nationality. They have the right to know and, as far as possible, to be cared for, by their parents.\n<\/br><\/br>\nArticle 8\n<\/br>\nGovernments should respect children's right to a name, a nationality and family ties.\n<\/br><\/br>\nArticle 9\n<\/br>\nChildren should not be separated from their parents unless it is for their own good (for example if a parent is mistreating or neglecting a child.) Children whose parents have separated have the right to stay in contact with both parents, unless this might harm the child.\n<\/br><\/br>\nArticle 10\n<\/br>\nFamilies who live in different countries should be allowed to move between those countries so that parents and children can stay in contact, or get back together as a family.\n<\/br><\/br>\nArticle 11\n<\/br>\nGovernments should take steps to stop children being taken out of their own country illegally.\n<\/br><\/br>\nArticle 12\n<\/br>\nChildren have the right to say what they think should happen, when adults are making decisions that affect them, and to have their opinions taken into account.\n<\/br><\/br>\nArticle 13\n<\/br>\nChildren have the right to get and to share information, as long as the information is not damaging to them or to others.\n<\/br><\/br>\nArticle 14\n<\/br>\nChildren have the right to think and believe what they want, and to practise their religion, as long as they are not stopping other people from enjoying their rights.

The law should protect them from attacks against their way of life, their good name, their families and their homes.\n<\/br><\/br>\nArticle 17\n<\/br>\nChildren have the right to reliable information from the mass media.

Rich countries should help poorer countries achieve this.\n<\/br><\/br>\nArticle 25\n<\/br>\nChildren who are looked after by their local authority, rather than by their parents, should have someone review the situation regularly.\n<\/br><\/br>\nArticle 26\n<\/br>\nThe Government should provide extra money for the children of families in need.\n<\/br><\/br>\nArticle 27\n<\/br>\nChildren have a right to a standard of living that is good enough to meet their physical and mental needs. The Government should help families who cannot afford to provide this.\n<\/br><\/br>\nArticle 28\n<\/br>\nChildren have a right to an education. Discipline in schools should respect children\u2019s human dignity. Primary education should be free. Wealthy countries should help poorer countries achieve this.\n<\/br><\/br>\nArticle 29\n<\/br>\nEducation should develop each child's personality and talents to the full. It should encourage children to respect their parents, and their own and other cultures.\n<\/br><\/br>\nArticle 30\n<\/br>\nChildren have a right to learn and use the language and customs of their families, whether these are shared by the majority of people in the country or not.\n<\/br><\/br>\nArticle 31\n<\/br>\nAll children have a right to relax and play, and to join in a wide range of activities.\n<\/br><\/br>\nArticle 32\n<\/br>\nThe Government should protect children from work that is dangerous, or that might harm their health or their education.\n<\/br><\/br>\nArticle 33\n<\/br>\nThe Government should provide ways of protecting children from dangerous drugs.\n<\/br><\/br>\nArticle 34\n<\/br>\nThe Government should protect children from sexual abuse.\n<\/br><\/br>\nArticle 35\n<\/br>\nThe Government should make sure that children are not abducted or sold.\n<\/br><\/br>\nArticle 36\n<\/br>\nChildren should be protected from any activities that could harm their development.\n<\/br><\/br>\nArticle 37\n<\/br>\nChildren who break the law should not be treated cruelly.

In addition to this, it has extensively mobilized actions for the realization of the\u00a0<b>rights<\/b>\u00a0and development of children worldwide.<\/p><p>It was not an overnight initiative that resulted in the adoption of the Child Rights. It took several years of movements and activism on shaping favourable, positive and constructive attitudes toward children, and also inciting actions to improve their well-being. The enormous efforts involved toward the implementation of the Convention, the significant amount of resources committed to this cause, and the overall effectiveness of the systems put in place for the execution process have a bearing on the success of child well-being outcomes.<\/p><p>Over the last 20 or so years, implementation of the Convention and its effect on child well-being varied from country to country and from one region of the world to the other. Based on analysis, there has been outstanding progress at a global level in addressing the issues related to children. These include progress in access to services, reaching their fullest potential through education, enactment of laws that upholds the principle of the best interests of child, and child survival.<\/p><p>Though a noteworthy progress has been achieved, yet in developing countries, particularly India, there is still a long way to go in realising the rights of children. Though all the relevant rules and policies are in place, there is a lack in enforcement initiatives. As barriers, there are several factors that forbid effective implementation of the laws. Due to relatively low success in achieving concrete child development outcomes in India, the condition of<b>\u00a0underprivileged kids and underprivileged youth<\/b>\u00a0is harsh and needs urgent attention. There is a need to intensify efforts for children welfare at all levels to implement the rules and provisions of the Convention and contribute to create a world suitable for children.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-50 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-e76e683\" data-id=\"e76e683\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-3bd8d48 elementor-widget elementor-widget-image\" data-id=\"3bd8d48\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"image.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"375\" height=\"475\" src=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/empowerment-jantar-mantar.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-image-56597\" alt=\"Child Rights\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/empowerment-jantar-mantar.jpg 375w, https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/empowerment-jantar-mantar-237x300.jpg 237w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-section elementor-top-section elementor-element elementor-element-4e25842 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default\" data-id=\"4e25842\" data-element_type=\"section\" data-settings=\"{&quot;_ha_eqh_enable&quot;:false}\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-50 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-2322574\" data-id=\"2322574\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-004bf4d elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"004bf4d\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Child Rights and the world<\/b><\/p><p>People from across the world striving for social justice have often directed their efforts toward the most vulnerable in society\u2014the children. From Princess Diana&#8217;s charitable work on behalf of children to the efforts of activists like Grace Abbott and the youngest Nobel laureate in history\u2014Ms. Malala Yousafzai, these famous children&#8217;s right activists have put commendable efforts in helping improve the lives of the youngest citizens.<\/p><p>2014 Nobel Peace Prize awardees\u2014Ms. Malala Yousafzai and Mr. Kailash Satyarthi have reminded us all of the need to keep on advancing in providing opportunities that has an important effect on all children. The opportunities are meant to be meaningful enough to allow them to learn and gain the mindsets and skills that would empower them to be free, develop themselves, their communities and the world.<\/p><p>Mr. Kailash Satyarthi\u2019s struggle to liberate children from child labour had cost him many life threats, including bullet wounds by those who exploit young boys and girls for economic gain. Wearing flak jackets, and armed with strong determination, he and his team raided many illegal factories and mines to rescue the children who are sold into servitude. It has been 30 years now since he started his movement. A movement that has one clear purpose\u2014no child shall be a slave.<\/p><p>On the other hand, when one thinks of\u00a0<b>Ms. Malala Yousafzai<\/b>, the first thing that pops in one\u2019s mind is education. The second is\u2014education for girls. In 2009, when she was just 11, she wrote to BBC about the norm of banning female education under the Taliban regime in the Swat Valley (her hometown). Her article gained tremendous momentum worldwide. She started her fight for the education of girls at that small age and began to speak publicly and to the press, which caused her and her family receive constant death threats.<\/p><p>&#8220;I strongly feel that this is a big honour to hundreds of millions of the children who have been deprived of their childhood and freedom and education.&#8221; \u2013 Mr. Kailash Satyarthi.<\/p><p>&#8220;I speak not for myself but for those without voice&#8230; those who have fought for their rights&#8230; their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated.&#8221; \u2013 Ms. Malala Yousafzai.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-50 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-f1f8b9a\" data-id=\"f1f8b9a\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-56cf62d ha-testimonial--left ha-testimonial--basic ha-has-bg-overlay elementor-widget elementor-widget-ha-testimonial happy-addon ha-testimonial\" data-id=\"56cf62d\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"ha-testimonial.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"ha-testimonial__content\">\n\t\t\t\u201cWhose children we are talking about?

Visionaries of the world understood that peace meant guaranteeing every person certain rights that are conditional for humanity\u2014education being one of the most important.<\/p><p>The addition of the Right to Education (RTE) in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 was the beginning of a remarkable expansion of educational opportunities around the world. The parliament of India enacted the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory\u00a0<b>Education Act or Right<\/b>\u00a0to Education Act (RTE) on August 2009. The same got enforced on April 1st 2010.<\/p><p>As per the act, education is a fundamental right of every child who is between 6 and 14 years old. The act also states that until the completion of elementary education, no child shall be held back, expelled or required to pass a board examination. There is also a provision for special training of school drop-outs to bring them up to par with students of the same age.<\/p><p>As a charity for child rights,\u00a0<b>Smile Foundation<\/b>\u00a0has been providing education to marginalized children in poor rural and urban communities in 25 states of the country. Its flagship programme &#8211;\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/education.html\"><b>Mission Education<\/b><\/a>\u00a0exemplifies the global struggle for universal education. The programme has succeeded in bringing more than 200,000 children to school since its start in the year 2002.<\/p><p>Underprivileged kids lag at all stages of education. When earning a livelihood and taking care of the members of the family becomes a primary matter of concern in one\u2019s life, education stands a little or, very often, no chance of pursuance. For the millions of underprivileged people in India, education is a high-priced luxury, and this negative outlook continues on with every new generation. Poverty damages childhood with significant effects on a child\u2019s physical and mental health, as well as educational achievement. It limits the expectations of the child\u2019s ability to perform well in school, constantly reminding him\/her of the miniscule chance he\/she has to overcome adversity and poverty.<\/p><p>With its development interventions that are focused on social welfare of children, Smile Foundation has raised those expectations among the hardest-to-reach children. Recent mark-sheets of the students in all ME centres has shown Smile Foundation primary school students outperforming their peers, with a very high passing rate. Last year, 51% of the total beneficiaries in Mission Education centres across India were girls. Also, 87% of the total eligible students are successfully mainstreamed in private and government schools.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/\">Smile Foundation<\/a>\u00a0is a children charity that has been working for children welfare since its inception.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Child Rights in India &#8211; Right To Education And Health They are abandoned.
