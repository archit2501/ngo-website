This project is specifically targeted at Bhiwadi and Greater Noida locations, focusing on underserved and weaker sections of the community, including adolescent girls, young married couples, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.<\/p><p>The primary objectives of this project are to raise awareness about reproductive and sexual health issues, empower adolescent girls and young women to challenge gender stereotypes and improve their overall health and social status. Over the course of one year, this extensive project aims to reach approximately 5000 women and adolescent girls, providing them with vital knowledge and support.<\/p><p>Through various interventions, including workshops, awareness campaigns, and counseling sessions, the project aims to generate awareness of reproductive and sexual health issues. By equipping adolescent girls and young women with confidence and assertiveness, the project strives to empower them to challenge societal norms and improve their health outcomes.<\/p><p>An important aspect of this project is to encourage positive changes in the health-seeking behavior of the targeted group, particularly concerning reproductive and sexual health. By providing access to healthcare services, counseling, and information, the project aims to promote a proactive approach to reproductive and sexual health, leading to improved health outcomes for women and adolescent girls.<\/p><p>The collaboration between the Honda India Foundation and Smile Foundation exemplifies the commitment of both organizations toward women&#8217;s empowerment and improving reproductive health outcomes. Through their joint efforts, they are addressing the unique needs of underserved women and adolescent girls, empowering them to make informed decisions about their health and challenging social norms that perpetuate gender inequality.<\/p><p>The project&#8217;s comprehensive approach, which combines healthcare services and awareness campaigns, ensures a holistic impact on the targeted community. By focusing on reproductive health education and healthcare, the project not only empowers women and adolescent girls but also contributes to building healthier and more equitable societies.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Honda India Foundation Empowering Women and Adolescent Girls Through Reproductive Health Education and Healthcare Services In collaboration with Honda India Foundation, Smile Foundation is implementing a project titled &#8216;Empowering Women [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"elementor_header_footer","meta":{"footnotes":""},"class_list":["post-81176","page","type-page","status-publish","hentry"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v24.4 -
