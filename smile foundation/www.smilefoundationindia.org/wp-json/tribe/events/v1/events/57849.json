During the workshop, Shabista discussed about puberty with the SHVs informing them about the physical changes that take place in an adolescent girl&#8217;s body. At the end, the SHVs did role plays in groups to demonstrate their understanding on the topic.<\/p>\n<p>An animated movie was shown to introduce STI\/RTI to the volunteers, which was followed by another round of role plays. The training turned out to be extremely informative and beneficial for the volunteers, who had earlier hesitated to talk about these issues, but are now confident enough to be the spokespersons for these issues in their community.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"27-swabhiman-volunteers-trained-on-reproductive-and-menstrual-health-2","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/reproductive-menstrual-1.jpg","id":57852,"extension":"jpg","width":1926,"height":600,"filesize":"92896","sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":93,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"8910","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/reproductive-menstrual-1-300x93.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"52073","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/reproductive-menstrual-1-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"6234","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/reproductive-menstrual-1-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":239,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"34367","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/reproductive-menstrual-1-768x239.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":479,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"92036","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/reproductive-menstrual-1-1536x479.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":374,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"65414","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/reproductive-menstrual-1-1200x374.jpg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2013-11-18 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2013","month":"11","day":"18","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2013-11-18 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2013","month":"11","day":"18","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2013-11-17 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2013","month":"11","day":"17","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2013-11-18 18:29:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2013","month":"11","day":"18","hour":"18","minutes":"29","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Swabhiman Happenings","slug":"swabhiman-happenings","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":50,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":127,"filter":"raw","id":50,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/50","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":56458,"author":"2","status":"publish","date":"2022-11-08 11:17:38","date_utc":"2022-11-08 05:47:38","modified":"2022-11-08 11:17:38","modified_utc":"2022-11-08 05:47:38","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/new-delhi\/","venue":"New Delhi","slug":"new-delhi","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"New Delhi","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=56458","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=56458"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"27 Swabhiman volunteers trained on Reproductive and Menstrual Health","description":"&lt;p&gt;A training session was organized for Swabhiman Health Volunteers (SHVs) and Community Health Educators (CHEs), on STI\/RTI, HIV AIDS and menstrual hygiene and its relevance for adolescent girls and women [&hellip;]&lt;\/p&gt;\\n","image":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/reproductive-menstrual-1.jpg","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/workshops-events\/27-swabhiman-volunteers-trained-on-reproductive-and-menstrual-health-2\/","eventAttendanceMode":"https:\/\/schema.org\/OfflineEventAttendanceMode","eventStatus":"https:\/\/schema.org\/EventScheduled","startDate":"2013-11-18T00:00:00+05:30","endDate":"2013-11-18T23:59:59+05:30","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"New Delhi","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"performer":"Organization"}}
