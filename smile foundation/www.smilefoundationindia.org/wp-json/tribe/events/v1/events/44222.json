Everybody had a field day and the children were very happy by the love they received from the Puma employees..<\/p>\n<p class=\"partnertext\" align=\"justify\">One of the employees also spoke of her experience of visiting the centre. She said, \u201cThe visit to Sumangali Seva Ashram was definitely a memorable day. The feeling one gets to see the happiness and sheer excitement in the eyes of all the kids is unexplainable. We as a team had an amazing day spreading the Christmas cheer among all kids; we got the chance to interact with a lot of sharp minds of the future generation to come. All in all, it was a wonderful experience and I hope to be a part of many more such activities to come\u201d.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"puma-employees-spend-a-fun-day-with-mission-education-children","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/puma-employees.jpg","id":44223,"extension":"jpg","width":1926,"height":600,"filesize":"142011","sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":93,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"11007","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/puma-employees-300x93.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"71197","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/puma-employees-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"8484","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/puma-employees-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":239,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"46229","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/puma-employees-768x239.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":479,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"129704","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/puma-employees-1536x479.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":374,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"90407","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/puma-employees-1200x374.jpg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2016-12-21 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2016","month":"12","day":"21","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2016-12-21 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2016","month":"12","day":"21","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2016-12-20 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2016","month":"12","day":"20","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2016-12-21 18:29:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2016","month":"12","day":"21","hour":"18","minutes":"29","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Workshop &amp; Events","slug":"workshops-events","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":9,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":650,"filter":"raw","id":9,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/9","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":43895,"author":"1","status":"publish","date":"2022-09-26 18:53:28","date_utc":"2022-09-26 13:23:28","modified":"2022-09-26 18:53:28","modified_utc":"2022-09-26 13:23:28","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/delhi\/","venue":"Delhi","slug":"delhi","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Delhi","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43895","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43895"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Puma employees spend a fun day with Mission Education children","description":"&lt;p&gt;Puma employees on the eve of Christmas spread much joy and love in one of the Mission Education centres of Smile Foundation.
