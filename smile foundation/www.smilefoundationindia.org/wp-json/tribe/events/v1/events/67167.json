The children received the prize according to their contribution towards the education and development of underprivileged children. The children are sensitized in the morning assemblies and other sessions; which include the value of empathy, care and integrity in life; how to grow up as a successful as well as happy individual, among other subjects. The assembly talk was a way to educate the children of the hardships children in urban slums and extremely remote areas face when they want to peruse a good education.<\/p>\n<p>Smile Foundation visits various privileged schools across India and conducts engaging sessions for the young minds, under CFC programme. Children are sensitized in various causes, value systems and are ushered to realize their importance in growing up as responsible citizens of the country.<\/p>\n<p>During last one year, Smile Foundation reached out to nearly 1 Million privileged children in over 1000 schools spread across 417 districts of India, through Child For Child (CFC) programme. In addition, their parents and teachers were also involved in the process.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"prize-distribution-session-conducted-under-cfc-programme-2","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/prize-distribution-18nov19.jpg","id":67168,"extension":"jpg","width":1926,"height":600,"filesize":130016,"sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":93,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":11491,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/prize-distribution-18nov19-300x93.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":78929,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/prize-distribution-18nov19-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":7386,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/prize-distribution-18nov19-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":239,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":50252,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/prize-distribution-18nov19-768x239.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":479,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":146101,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/prize-distribution-18nov19-1536x479.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":374,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":100898,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/prize-distribution-18nov19-1200x374.jpg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2019-09-18 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"09","day":"18","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2019-09-18 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"09","day":"18","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2019-09-17 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"09","day":"17","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2019-09-18 18:29:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"09","day":"18","hour":"18","minutes":"29","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"CFC Happenings","slug":"cfc-happenings","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":68,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":188,"filter":"raw","id":68,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/68","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":44702,"author":"1","status":"publish","date":"2022-09-29 17:22:46","date_utc":"2022-09-29 11:52:46","modified":"2022-09-29 17:22:46","modified_utc":"2022-09-29 11:52:46","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/nagpur\/","venue":"Nagpur","slug":"nagpur","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Nagpur","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=44702","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=44702"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Prize distribution session conducted under CFC programme","description":"&lt;p&gt;A prize distribution ceremony was conducted at a school in Ambazari, Nagpur.
