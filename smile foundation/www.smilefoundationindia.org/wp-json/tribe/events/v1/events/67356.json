teachers, joined Smile Foundation&#8217;s value education session conducted under Child for Child (CFC) programme at Amreli in Gujarat.<\/p>\n<p class=\"partnertext\" align=\"justify\">Komal Talsaniya from Smile Foundation conducted the session, which was appreciated whole-heartedly by the children, teachers as well as the school management.<\/p>\n<p class=\"partnertext\" align=\"justify\">CFC has been designed for bringing children from both the worlds together, sensitising the privileged children about the life and aspiration of their less privileged counterparts and encouraging them for
