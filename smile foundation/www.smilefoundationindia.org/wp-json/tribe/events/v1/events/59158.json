There are many children in Delhi city who enroll in school but due to the distance between their schools and their homes they either drop out of school or are irregular and fail to keep up with lessons.<\/p>\n<p>To curb the problem Adobe joined hands with Smile Foundation and conducted an employee engagement programme during which the volunteers from Adobe built bicycles with kids from a Mission Education centre in Delhi. Teams of four built a bike each and one kid was also involved in each in building his\/her own bike. The employees and the children built the bikes from scratch which were later donated to the same children. The kids were chosen by the teachers based on the distance from their homes to the school and their socio-economic backgrounds. The children were overjoyed to receive the gift and promised to work harder in school. Poster making competition was took held where gifts were given to the best posters. The children also enjoyed their refreshments with the employees.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"adobe-employees-build-bikes-with-smile-foundation-children","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/build-bikes-20feb19.jpg","id":59159,"extension":"jpg","width":1926,"height":600,"filesize":"150731","sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":93,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"10148","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/build-bikes-20feb19-300x93.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"73403","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/build-bikes-20feb19-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"8172","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/build-bikes-20feb19-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":239,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"44822","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/build-bikes-20feb19-768x239.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":479,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"145762","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/build-bikes-20feb19-1536x479.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":374,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"96267","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/build-bikes-20feb19-1200x374.jpg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2019-02-20 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"02","day":"20","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2019-02-20 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"02","day":"20","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2019-02-19 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"02","day":"19","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2019-02-20 18:29:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"02","day":"20","hour":"18","minutes":"29","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Educational activities &amp; happenings for underprivileged children","slug":"educational-activities-happenings-for-underprivileged-children","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":51,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":216,"filter":"raw","id":51,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/51","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":43974,"author":"1","status":"publish","date":"2022-09-26 19:38:40","date_utc":"2022-09-26 14:08:40","modified":"2022-09-26 19:38:40","modified_utc":"2022-09-26 14:08:40","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/noida\/","venue":"Noida","slug":"noida","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Noida","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43974","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43974"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Adobe Employees build bikes with Smile Foundation children","description":"&lt;p&gt;School is a distant dream for many and for some it is just the distance which makes it impossible for them to go to school.
