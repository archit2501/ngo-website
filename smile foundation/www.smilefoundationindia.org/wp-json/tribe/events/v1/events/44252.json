Celebrity chef Vikas Khanna and Bollywood\u2019s rising new star of\u2018Mirzya\u2019 fame, Saiyami Kher shared a special brunch with the children. Chef Khanna served Quaker Oats based pink beetroot idlis, pizzas, burgers, spaghetti and cookies, all the excitement of the young children.<\/p>\n<p class=\"partnertext\" align=\"justify\">Chef Khanna also commented, \u201cThe problem of hunger and malnutrition in India cannot be solved in a day, and certainly cannot be solved by one person or entity. If we all make an effort to bring a smile to even one child, I think we\u2019ll get the true blessings we yearn for in the festivities. That\u2019s the core of Quaker Feed a Child and I am happy to be a part of it.\u201d<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"chef-vikas-khanna-and-quaker-pledge-to-a-feed-a-child-this-festive-season","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/quaker-pledge-vikas.jpg","id":44253,"extension":"jpg","width":1926,"height":600,"filesize":"122800","sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":93,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"9979","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/quaker-pledge-vikas-300x93.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"62545","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/quaker-pledge-vikas-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"7477","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/quaker-pledge-vikas-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":239,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"40589","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/quaker-pledge-vikas-768x239.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":479,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"113772","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/quaker-pledge-vikas-1536x479.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":374,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"79354","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/quaker-pledge-vikas-1200x374.jpg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2016-10-16 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2016","month":"10","day":"16","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2016-10-16 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2016","month":"10","day":"16","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2016-10-15 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2016","month":"10","day":"15","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2016-10-16 18:29:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2016","month":"10","day":"16","hour":"18","minutes":"29","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Workshop &amp; Events","slug":"workshops-events","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":9,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":650,"filter":"raw","id":9,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/9","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":43910,"author":"1","status":"publish","date":"2022-09-26 19:00:31","date_utc":"2022-09-26 13:30:31","modified":"2022-09-26 19:00:31","modified_utc":"2022-09-26 13:30:31","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/mumbai\/","venue":"Mumbai","slug":"mumbai","country":"India","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mumbai","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","addressCountry":"India"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43910","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43910"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Chef Vikas Khanna and Quaker pledge to a feed a child this festive season","description":"&lt;p&gt;Quaker Oats and celebrity chef Vikas Khanna joined hands to pledge support to the cause of nutrition along with Smile Foundation on the occasion of World Food Day.
