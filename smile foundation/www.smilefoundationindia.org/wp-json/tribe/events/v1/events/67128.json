It is important because for a particular teaching method to be appropriate and efficient it has to be in relation with the characteristic of the learner and the type of learning it is supposed to bring about.<\/p>\n<p>An engaging classroom is important the degree of attention, curiosity, interest, optimism, and passion that students show when they are learning or being taught, extends to the level of motivation they have to learn and progress in their education.<\/p>\n<p>Keeping both these things in mind teachers were sensitized about various ways to keep the children engaged and inculcate new ways in the teaching methodology to keep the classroom teaching-learning process more interesting.<\/p>\n<p>Smile Foundation visits various privileged schools across India and conducts engaging sessions for the young minds, under CFC programme. Smile Foundation believes along with education of children sensitization in various causes, value systems should be ushered to realize their importance in growing up as responsible citizens of the country.<\/p>\n<p>CFC currently reaches out to nearly one million privileged children in 900 schools spread across 417 districts of India, every year.
