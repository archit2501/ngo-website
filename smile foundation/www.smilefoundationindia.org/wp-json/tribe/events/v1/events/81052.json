At Smile Foundation, we are committed to promoting &#8220;Civic Driven Change&#8221; by actively involving schools, teachers, students, and parents in creating sustainable transformations. Our &#8220;Child for Child&#8221; drive encourages privileged students to extend care and empathy towards underprivileged children, bridging the gap between the haves and have-nots.<\/p>\n<p>With great enthusiasm, we engaged 15 schools in anti-child labour activities, and the response we received in the form of pictures, collages, school notes, and press releases is truly heartwarming. The awareness displayed by the students regarding this grave issue is particularly commendable.<\/p>\n<p>By involving schools, we aim to instill a sense of responsibility and empathy in young minds, making them aware of the challenges faced by their underprivileged peers. Through educational initiatives, discussions, and creative projects, we encourage students to reflect on the importance of eradicating child labour and strive towards a more equitable society.<\/p>\n<p>The active participation of schools in these anti-child labour activities demonstrates their commitment to creating a brighter future. It signifies a collective effort toward raising awareness, advocating for change, and nurturing a compassionate society. Each picture, collage, school note, and press release serves as a reminder that every small step contributes to the larger goal of eliminating child labour.<\/p>\n<p>We cherish the enthusiastic response from schools, as well as the dedication shown by students and teachers in addressing this pressing issue. Their efforts exemplify the power of education and empathy in driving social change. Together, we can work towards a society where every child&#8217;s rights are protected, where education is accessible to all, and where child labour becomes a thing of the past.<\/p>\n<p>On this International Labour Day, let us reiterate our commitment to creating a world where children are free to learn, play, and grow, unburdened by the harsh realities of child labour.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"school-activities-on-international-labour-day-on-1st-may-2023","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/WhatsApp-Image-2023-05-14-at-9.27.23-PM.jpeg","id":81053,"extension":"jpeg","width":1200,"height":900,"filesize":408430,"sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":225,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":25184,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/WhatsApp-Image-2023-05-14-at-9.27.23-PM-300x225.jpeg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":768,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":179798,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/WhatsApp-Image-2023-05-14-at-9.27.23-PM-1024x768.jpeg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":10068,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/WhatsApp-Image-2023-05-14-at-9.27.23-PM-150x150.jpeg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":576,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":112323,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/WhatsApp-Image-2023-05-14-at-9.27.23-PM-768x576.jpeg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2023-05-01 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2023","month":"05","day":"01","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2023-05-01 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2023","month":"05","day":"01","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2023-04-30 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2023","month":"04","day":"30","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2023-05-01 18:29:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2023","month":"05","day":"01","hour":"18","minutes":"29","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"CFC Happenings","slug":"cfc-happenings","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":68,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":188,"filter":"raw","id":68,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/68","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":56827,"author":"2","status":"publish","date":"2022-11-08 13:49:35","date_utc":"2022-11-08 08:19:35","modified":"2022-11-08 13:49:35","modified_utc":"2022-11-08 08:19:35","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/delhi-ncr\/","venue":"Delhi &#038; NCR","slug":"delhi-ncr","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Delhi &#038; NCR","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=56827","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=56827"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"School Activities on International Labour Day on 1st May 2023","description":"&lt;p&gt;On International Labour Day, it is crucial to shine a spotlight on the pressing issue of child labour, especially in India, which unfortunately has the highest number of child labourers [&hellip;]&lt;\/p&gt;\\n","image":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/WhatsApp-Image-2023-05-14-at-9.27.23-PM.jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/workshops-events\/school-activities-on-international-labour-day-on-1st-may-2023\/","eventAttendanceMode":"https:\/\/schema.org\/OfflineEventAttendanceMode","eventStatus":"https:\/\/schema.org\/EventScheduled","startDate":"2023-05-01T00:00:00+05:30","endDate":"2023-05-01T23:59:59+05:30","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Delhi &#038; NCR","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"performer":"Organization"}}
