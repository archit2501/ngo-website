Excited and full of energy, around 400 participants became a part of this noble cause.<\/p>\n<p>Education is not only a ladder of opportunity but also an investment in our future. The enthusiasm of employees from three corporates- Schindler India, IHS Markit and R1 RCM -was a sight to behold. With placards in their hands, they ran so children who cannot afford education, may go to school.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Running for a social cause creates so much of excitement &amp; encouragement in everyone. In support of Every Child In School, we are trying to add the classroom of quality education for underprivileged children.&#8221;- said an employee from R1 RCM.<\/p>\n<p>This is what the team of IHS Markit had to say- &#8220;Education lays a strong foundation for every dream &amp; is important for everyone. With this goal in mind, we have joined hands with Smile Foundation in support of #EveryChildInSchool campaign. We are running for education of the less-privileged children.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The marathon turned out a huge success as everyone encouraged and showed unlimited enthusiasm for the education of children.
