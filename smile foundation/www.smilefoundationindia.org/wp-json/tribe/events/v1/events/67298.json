Students of the school attended the early morning session which included the value of empathy, care and integrity in life; how to grow up as a successful as well as happy individual, among other subjects. These children reside in remote rural areas and have less opportunity to interact with students from outside, hence, the assembly talk was a way to educate them of the hardships children in urban slums and extremely remote areas face when they want to persue a good education.<\/p>\n<p>Smile Foundation visits various privileged schools across India and conducts engaging sessions for the young minds, under CFC programme. Children are sensitized in various causes, value systems and are ushered to realize their importance in growing up as responsible citizens of the country.<\/p>\n<p>During last one year, Smile Foundation reached out to nearly 1 Million privileged children in over 1000 schools spread across 417 districts of India, through Child For Child (CFC) programme. In addition, their parents and teachers were also involved in the process.<\/p>\n<p>Smile Foundation is a national level development organisation directly benefitting over 400,000 children and their families every year, through more than 200 live welfare projects on education, healthcare, livelihood and women empowerment, in over 950 remote villages and slums across 25 states of India.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"assembly-talk-conducted-in-arunachal-pradesh","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/arunachal.jpg","id":67299,"extension":"jpg","width":1926,"height":600,"filesize":139170,"sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":93,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":11195,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/arunachal-300x93.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":70635,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/arunachal-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":7844,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/arunachal-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":239,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":46150,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/arunachal-768x239.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":479,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":127946,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/arunachal-1536x479.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":374,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":89730,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/arunachal-1200x374.jpg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2018-07-12 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"07","day":"12","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2018-07-12 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"07","day":"12","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2018-07-11 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"07","day":"11","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2018-07-12 18:29:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"07","day":"12","hour":"18","minutes":"29","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"CFC Happenings","slug":"cfc-happenings","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":68,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":188,"filter":"raw","id":68,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/68","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":67303,"author":"2","status":"publish","date":"2022-12-06 22:36:44","date_utc":"2022-12-06 17:06:44","modified":"2022-12-06 22:36:44","modified_utc":"2022-12-06 17:06:44","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/arunachal-pradesh\/","venue":"Arunachal Pradesh","slug":"arunachal-pradesh","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Arunachal Pradesh","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=67303","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=67303"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Assembly talk conducted in Arunachal Pradesh","description":"&lt;p&gt;An assembly talk was conducted for school children under Smile Foundation\u2019s Child for Child (CFC) programme in Arunachal Pradesh.
