Termed \u2018Miles for Smiles\u2019, the initiative sought to highlight the plight of millions of children forced into child labour and to spread awareness about importance of education amongst the most deserving children.<\/p>\n<p>The event was flagged off from Bandra, Mumbai around 6:00 am. Around 50 Harley owners from the Seven Islands H.O.G. extended their support by riding 100 kms to Lonavala during this event. Proceeds from the ride will benefit the children under Smile Foundation\u2019s Mission Education programme.<\/p>\n<p>Ameya Kapnadak, Assistant Director, Seven Islands H.O.G. Chapter, said, \u201cIt is quite ironic, actually. A couple of days from now, the world celebrates the International Labor Day as a turning point in worker rights. And here in India, we see rampant child labor \u2013 right from maids in our homes to farm and factory workers. So we said let\u2019s do our bit to put these kids where they belong \u2013 in schools.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEducation is the most effective tool that can help the less privileged children come out of the vicious cycle of poverty and suffering, and transform into an empowered next generation. By involving the privileged section of the society proactively in the process of child development, we aim to bring real and permanent change in the lives of the most deserving children,\u201d said Mr. Vikram Singh Verma, Chief Operating Officer, Smile Foundation.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"riding-to-pave-the-road-for-childrens-education","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/hogs-mumbai.jpg","id":44627,"extension":"jpg","width":1926,"height":600,"filesize":"145299","sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":93,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"10975","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/hogs-mumbai-300x93.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"72849","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/hogs-mumbai-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"8475","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/hogs-mumbai-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":239,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"47076","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/hogs-mumbai-768x239.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":479,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"132284","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/hogs-mumbai-1536x479.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":374,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"92545","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/hogs-mumbai-1200x374.jpg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2014-04-27 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2014","month":"04","day":"27","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2014-04-27 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2014","month":"04","day":"27","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2014-04-26 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2014","month":"04","day":"26","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2014-04-27 18:29:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2014","month":"04","day":"27","hour":"18","minutes":"29","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Workshop &amp; Events","slug":"workshops-events","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":9,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":650,"filter":"raw","id":9,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/9","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":43910,"author":"1","status":"publish","date":"2022-09-26 19:00:31","date_utc":"2022-09-26 13:30:31","modified":"2022-09-26 19:00:31","modified_utc":"2022-09-26 13:30:31","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/mumbai\/","venue":"Mumbai","slug":"mumbai","country":"India","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mumbai","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","addressCountry":"India"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43910","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43910"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Riding to pave the road for children\u2019s education","description":"&lt;p&gt;Smile Foundation in association with Seven Islands HOG (Harley Owners Group) organized a Harley ride to support the cause of children\u2019s education.
