We awarded them one sewing machine and since then we have been supporting them by giving one sewing machine every year. Now the project has 27 machines since its foundation and more than 100 women have successfully completed a 3 months certified course of sewing. It has empowered more than 100 homemakers and girls, to earn their livelihood by grooming their sewing skills. The project also designs and stitch clothes for the new born and these clothes are given to the poorest of the poor infants born in the nearby Government Medical College, Nagpur.<\/p>\n<p>The objective of the project is to empower the home makers and the slum dwellers from nearby the school and the said site of the project.<\/p>\n<p>Around 20 home makers who had developed their sewing skills through this centre participated in today&#8217;s event, along with the students of the school. They all were felicitated by Ms Monica Mor.<\/p>\n<p>We were all welcome by Dr Vandana Benjamin and she placed the mission of their foundation.<\/p>\n<p>This project is the local initiative and intervention by the Central CFC team and developed through ISP.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"international-womens-day-celebration-project-save-gender-held-in-nagpur","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/international-nagpur-2020.jpg","id":67135,"extension":"jpg","width":1926,"height":600,"filesize":152246,"sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":93,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":11139,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/international-nagpur-2020-300x93.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":80542,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/international-nagpur-2020-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":7694,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/international-nagpur-2020-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":239,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":50497,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/international-nagpur-2020-768x239.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":479,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":150881,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/international-nagpur-2020-1536x479.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":374,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":103544,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/international-nagpur-2020-1200x374.jpg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2020-03-05 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2020","month":"03","day":"05","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2020-03-05 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2020","month":"03","day":"05","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2020-03-04 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2020","month":"03","day":"04","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2020-03-05 18:29:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2020","month":"03","day":"05","hour":"18","minutes":"29","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"CFC Happenings","slug":"cfc-happenings","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":68,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":188,"filter":"raw","id":68,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/68","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":44702,"author":"1","status":"publish","date":"2022-09-29 17:22:46","date_utc":"2022-09-29 11:52:46","modified":"2022-09-29 17:22:46","modified_utc":"2022-09-29 11:52:46","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/nagpur\/","venue":"Nagpur","slug":"nagpur","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Nagpur","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=44702","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=44702"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"International Women&#8217;s Day Celebration, &#8220;Project Save Gender&#8221; Held in Nagpur","description":"&lt;p&gt;On the eve of International Women\\'s Day, Celebrations were held in our local project at Nagpur, &quot;Project Save Gender&quot; in Hardik Convent, Omkar Nagar, Nagpur.
