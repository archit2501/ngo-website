They toil through the day without any breaks to make the ends meet but despite their struggles; these families do whatever they can for their children, especially when it comes to sending them to schools. With a little support and enabling environment, the children from these communities can create a better life.<\/p>\n<p>In Malad (West), Mumbai, a Mission Education initiative has been launched with the support of BrowserStack Software for providing quality education to these children. The children will have access to a digital classroom, regular health check-ups, toilets, and clean drinking water.<\/p>\n<p>Mission Education is a national level programme of Smile Foundation, which is committed to providing basic education and healthcare to underprivileged children.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"browserstack-joins-hands-with-smile-foundation-to-support-education-of-underprivileged-children","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/browserstack-22june19.jpg","id":43868,"extension":"jpg","width":1926,"height":600,"filesize":"161657","sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":93,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"11412","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/browserstack-22june19-300x93.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"80390","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/browserstack-22june19-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"8663","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/browserstack-22june19-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":239,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"50139","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/browserstack-22june19-768x239.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":479,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"156259","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/browserstack-22june19-1536x479.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":374,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"105008","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/browserstack-22june19-1200x374.jpg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2019-06-24 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"06","day":"24","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2019-06-24 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"06","day":"24","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2019-06-23 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"06","day":"23","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2019-06-24 18:29:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"06","day":"24","hour":"18","minutes":"29","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Workshop &amp; Events","slug":"workshops-events","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":9,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":650,"filter":"raw","id":9,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/9","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":[],"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Browserstack joins hands with Smile Foundation to support Education of underprivileged children","description":"&lt;p&gt;Life is difficult and uncertain for daily wage earners like construction workers and migrant labourers.
