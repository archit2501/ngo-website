Ltd., as part of their initiative to support Smile Foundation in the Joy of Giving, across various locations came together to spend some time with the kids at the Mission Education centres for various activities. The volunteers and the children were divided into groups and were given the task of making posters on various themes such as the importance of education in one\u2019s life, importance of health, making 2D and 3D objects on symmetrical mathematics etc. Also, they were engaged in making science models and performing skits on the themes of human rights, gender equality etc. Both the children and the employees were extremely happy to be a part of this activity. The children learnt a lot through these activities. We thank Ericsson India Global Services Pvt. Ltd. for making this a fun filled activity which led to a lot of knowledge building of the children too.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"get-involved\" class=\"container spacer\">\n<div class=\"heading\"><\/div>\n<\/div>","excerpt":"","slug":"ericsson-employees-spend-time-with-smile-kids","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/ericsson-employees-spend-1.jpg","id":44368,"extension":"jpg","width":1928,"height":600,"filesize":"143121","sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":93,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"11239","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/ericsson-employees-spend-1-300x93.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"72179","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/ericsson-employees-spend-1-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"7959","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/ericsson-employees-spend-1-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":239,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"46996","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/ericsson-employees-spend-1-768x239.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":478,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"130759","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/ericsson-employees-spend-1-1536x478.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":373,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"91820","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/ericsson-employees-spend-1-1200x373.jpg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2015-09-12 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2015","month":"09","day":"12","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2015-09-19 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2015","month":"09","day":"19","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2015-09-11 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2015","month":"09","day":"11","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2015-09-19 18:29:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2015","month":"09","day":"19","hour":"18","minutes":"29","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Workshop &amp; Events","slug":"workshops-events","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":9,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":650,"filter":"raw","id":9,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/9","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":44370,"author":"1","status":"publish","date":"2022-09-27 17:40:26","date_utc":"2022-09-27 12:10:26","modified":"2022-09-27 17:40:26","modified_utc":"2022-09-27 12:10:26","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/gurgaon-noida-delhi-bengaluru-chennai-mumbai-pune-kolkata\/","venue":"Gurgaon, Noida, Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, Mumbai, Pune, Kolkata","slug":"gurgaon-noida-delhi-bengaluru-chennai-mumbai-pune-kolkata","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Gurgaon, Noida, Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, Mumbai, Pune, Kolkata","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=44370","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=44370"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Ericsson employees spend time with Smile kids","description":"&lt;p&gt;Employees of Ericsson India Global Services Pvt.
