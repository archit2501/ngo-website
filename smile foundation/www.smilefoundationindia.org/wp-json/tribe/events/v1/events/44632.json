Continuing with her ongoing contribution for the education of underprivileged children, she has extended support towards the education of 75 girl children this year.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking about this association on her birthday, she said, \u201cWhen so many children are born unequal and are languishing silently, it becomes our moral duty to put a smile on their face. It&#8217;s my endeavor in life that if I want a peaceful sleep at night, I have to help others sleep peacefully without worry too. Giving is the essence of a good life.<\/p>\n<p>On my birthday if I can motivate more people to come forward and support the worthy cause of sending every girl child to school through Smile Foundation, I would consider this as the best gift ever in my life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Smile foundation believes that education is the most effective tool to help the less privileged children, particularly girls, come out of the vicious cycle of poverty and suffering, and transform them into an empowered next generation. By involving the privileged section of the society proactively in the process of child development, it aims to bring sustainable change in the lives of underprivileged children.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"dr-tarita-shankar-becomes-goodwill-ambassador-for-smile-foundation-in-pune","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/tarita-shankar-birthday.jpg","id":44633,"extension":"jpg","width":1928,"height":600,"filesize":"173029","sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":93,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"12202","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/tarita-shankar-birthday-300x93.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"83262","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/tarita-shankar-birthday-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"9298","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/tarita-shankar-birthday-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":239,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"53431","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/tarita-shankar-birthday-768x239.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":478,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"152435","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/tarita-shankar-birthday-1536x478.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":373,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"106065","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/tarita-shankar-birthday-1200x373.jpg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2014-04-25 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2014","month":"04","day":"25","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2014-04-25 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2014","month":"04","day":"25","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2014-04-24 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2014","month":"04","day":"24","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2014-04-25 18:29:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2014","month":"04","day":"25","hour":"18","minutes":"29","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Workshop &amp; Events","slug":"workshops-events","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":9,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":650,"filter":"raw","id":9,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/9","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":43921,"author":"1","status":"publish","date":"2022-09-26 19:05:41","date_utc":"2022-09-26 13:35:41","modified":"2022-09-26 19:05:41","modified_utc":"2022-09-26 13:35:41","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/pune\/","venue":"Pune","slug":"pune","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Pune","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43921","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43921"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Dr. Tarita Shankar becomes Goodwill Ambassador for Smile Foundation in Pune","description":"&lt;p&gt;Smile Foundation announced Dr. Tarita Shankar, Chairperson, Indira Group of Institutes, as its Goodwill Ambassador in Pune, to support the cause of education for girl children.
