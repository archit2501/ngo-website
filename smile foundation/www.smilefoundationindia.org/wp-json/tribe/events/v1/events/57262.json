The health camp aimed at promoting awareness about illness, identifying community members with health problems and helps the patients get affordable healthcare by further referring them to local government hospitals, all at their doorstep. In the camp, hemoglobin tests, weight measurement and blood pressure checks facilities were provided to beneficiaries. Counseling and consultation was also provided to the beneficiaries on their specific ailments by general physicians. Several women who attended the camp were anemic, had fungal skin infections, and gynecologic problems. Medicines for these common diseases were dispensed free of charge and more serious symptoms related to diseases like cancer were further referred to specialists in a local hospital.<\/p>\n<p>Swabhiman, meaning self-respect in English, was initiated in 2005 to address these challenges through a simple yet effective approach. The programme is specifically aimed at realization of both individual and collective self-esteem and inner strength for marginalised and socially excluded women and adolescent girls through innovative community practices.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"swabhiman-health-camp-for-residents-of-damru-nagar","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/shc-damru-nagar.jpg","id":57266,"extension":"jpg","width":1926,"height":600,"filesize":"122009","sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":93,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"9894","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/shc-damru-nagar-300x93.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"62493","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/shc-damru-nagar-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"7394","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/shc-damru-nagar-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":239,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"40429","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/shc-damru-nagar-768x239.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":479,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"114404","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/shc-damru-nagar-1536x479.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":374,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"79576","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/shc-damru-nagar-1200x374.jpg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2018-07-18 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"07","day":"18","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2018-07-18 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"07","day":"18","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2018-07-17 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"07","day":"17","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2018-07-18 18:29:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"07","day":"18","hour":"18","minutes":"29","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Swabhiman Happenings","slug":"swabhiman-happenings","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":50,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":127,"filter":"raw","id":50,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/50","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":43910,"author":"1","status":"publish","date":"2022-09-26 19:00:31","date_utc":"2022-09-26 13:30:31","modified":"2022-09-26 19:00:31","modified_utc":"2022-09-26 13:30:31","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/mumbai\/","venue":"Mumbai","slug":"mumbai","country":"India","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mumbai","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","addressCountry":"India"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43910","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43910"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Swabhiman health camp for residents of Damru Nagar","description":"&lt;p&gt;A health camp was organized on 18th July 2018 for the residents of Damru Nagar which provided medical consultation to 110 beneficiaries that included children (0 to 9 years), adolescents [&hellip;]&lt;\/p&gt;\\n","image":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/shc-damru-nagar.jpg","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/workshops-events\/swabhiman-health-camp-for-residents-of-damru-nagar\/","eventAttendanceMode":"https:\/\/schema.org\/OfflineEventAttendanceMode","eventStatus":"https:\/\/schema.org\/EventScheduled","startDate":"2018-07-18T00:00:00+05:30","endDate":"2018-07-18T23:59:59+05:30","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mumbai","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","addressCountry":"India"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"performer":"Organization"}}
