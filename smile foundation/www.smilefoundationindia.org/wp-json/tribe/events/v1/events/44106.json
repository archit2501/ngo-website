There are many children in Delhi city who enroll in school but due to the distance between their schools and their homes they either drop out of school or are irregular and fail to keep up with lessons.<\/p>\n<p>To curb the problem Adobe joined hands with Smile Foundation and conducted an employee engagement programme during which the volunteers from Adobe built bicycles with 4 kids from a Mission Education centre in Delhi. Teams of four builta bike each and one kid was also involved in each in building his\/her own bike. The employees and the children built the bikes from scratch which were later donated to the same children. The kids were chosen by the teachers based on the distance from their homes to the school and their socio-economic backgrounds. The children were overjoyed to receive the gift and promised to work harder in school.<\/p>\n<p>Smile Foundation is a national level development organisation directly benefitting over 400,000 children and their families every year, through more than 200 live welfare projects on education, healthcare, livelihood and women empowerment, in over 950 remote villages and slums across 25 states of India.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"adobe-employees-build-bikes-with-mission-education-center-students","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/adobe-build-bikes.jpg","id":44107,"extension":"jpg","width":1926,"height":600,"filesize":"197863","sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":93,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"10838","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/adobe-build-bikes-300x93.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"83666","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/adobe-build-bikes-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"8185","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/adobe-build-bikes-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":239,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"51276","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/adobe-build-bikes-768x239.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":479,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"162042","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/adobe-build-bikes-1536x479.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":374,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"108748","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/adobe-build-bikes-1200x374.jpg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2017-10-27 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"10","day":"27","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2017-10-27 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"10","day":"27","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2017-10-26 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"10","day":"26","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2017-10-27 18:29:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"10","day":"27","hour":"18","minutes":"29","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Workshop &amp; Events","slug":"workshops-events","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":9,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":650,"filter":"raw","id":9,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/9","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":43974,"author":"1","status":"publish","date":"2022-09-26 19:38:40","date_utc":"2022-09-26 14:08:40","modified":"2022-09-26 19:38:40","modified_utc":"2022-09-26 14:08:40","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/noida\/","venue":"Noida","slug":"noida","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Noida","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43974","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43974"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Adobe employees build bikes with Mission Education center students","description":"&lt;p&gt;School is a distant dream for many and for some it is just the distance which makes it impossible for them to go to school.
