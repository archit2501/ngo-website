The closing down of schools and staying at home and transition to virtual classrooms has impacted their mental well being. For millions of underprivileged children it has been more difficult as they have limited or no access to digital learning. For these children education has come to an abrupt halt. As per UNICEF data, over 76% children in India are on the wrong side of the digital divide.<\/p>\n<p>In this adverse scenario, the Smile Foundation team has been trying its best to help the less privileged children continue their education. From home visits to distributing worksheets and study material from door to door, from using alternate modes like television and radio to conducting cluster classes facilitated by community volunteers, different methods are being explored to ensure that education does not stop for the children despite the pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>An idea called &#8216;Be the Light to Spread the Light&#8217; has been developed for Diwali. Under this initiative a &#8220;wall of knowledge&#8221; was created in collaboration with Oppo India, consisting of an LED screen and attached smart phones. The aim is to give the less privileged children an opportunity to experience the exciting world of digital learning without having to bear the cost of owning a device. This initiative is expected to make learning in the neo normal scenario much more fun and engaging for the kids.<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;Wall of Knowledge&#8221; will be created with multiple community based organizations in Lucknow, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad and Noida.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"smile-foundation-and-oppo-india-launch-wall-of-knowledge","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/oppo_launch_nov_2020-1.jpg","id":43817,"extension":"jpg","width":1366,"height":426,"filesize":"57390","sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":94,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"8220","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/oppo_launch_nov_2020-1-300x94.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"55279","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/oppo_launch_nov_2020-1-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"5765","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/oppo_launch_nov_2020-1-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":240,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"35492","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/oppo_launch_nov_2020-1-768x240.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":374,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"69970","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/oppo_launch_nov_2020-1-1200x374.jpg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2020-11-05 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2020","month":"11","day":"05","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2020-11-05 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2020","month":"11","day":"05","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2020-11-04 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2020","month":"11","day":"04","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2020-11-05 18:29:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2020","month":"11","day":"05","hour":"18","minutes":"29","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":false,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Workshop &amp; Events","slug":"workshops-events","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":9,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":650,"filter":"raw","id":9,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/9","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":[],"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Smile Foundation and Oppo India launch &#8220;Wall of Knowledge&#8221;","description":"&lt;p&gt;While the pandemic has been difficult for everyone, children have been the most affected during this time.
