Keeping this in mind World Breast Feeding month was celebrated by Swabhiman workers along with community members which included expecting mothers, new mothers and mothers having breast feeding babies. The volunteers talked about the importance of breast feeding, the need for good nutritious food for expecting and new mothers. Around 150 women participated in the event making it a success.<\/p>\n<p>Swabhiman, meaning self-respect in English, was initiated in 2005 to address these challenges through a simple yet effective approach. The programme is specifically aimed at realization of both individual and collective self-esteem and inner strength for marginalised and socially excluded women and adolescent girls through innovative community practices.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"breast-feeding-day-celebrated-by-smile-foundations-swabhiman-programme","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/brest-feeding.jpg","id":57256,"extension":"jpg","width":1926,"height":600,"filesize":"188728","sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":93,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"11267","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/brest-feeding-300x93.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"80466","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/brest-feeding-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"8625","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/brest-feeding-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":239,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"49998","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/brest-feeding-768x239.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":479,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"156810","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/brest-feeding-1536x479.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":374,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"105111","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/brest-feeding-1200x374.jpg"}}},"all_day":false,"start_date":"2018-08-01 08:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"08","day":"01","hour":"08","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2018-08-07 17:00:00","end_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"08","day":"07","hour":"17","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_start_date":"2018-08-01 02:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"08","day":"01","hour":"02","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2018-08-07 11:30:00","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"08","day":"07","hour":"11","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Swabhiman Happenings","slug":"swabhiman-happenings","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":50,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":127,"filter":"raw","id":50,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/50","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":43895,"author":"1","status":"publish","date":"2022-09-26 18:53:28","date_utc":"2022-09-26 13:23:28","modified":"2022-09-26 18:53:28","modified_utc":"2022-09-26 13:23:28","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/delhi\/","venue":"Delhi","slug":"delhi","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Delhi","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43895","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43895"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Breast feeding day celebrated by Smile Foundation\u2019s Swabhiman programme","description":"&lt;p&gt;Set every August for the first seven days of the month, World Breastfeeding Week aims to highlight the huge benefits that breastfeeding can bring to the health and welfare of [&hellip;]&lt;\/p&gt;\\n","image":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/brest-feeding.jpg","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/workshops-events\/breast-feeding-day-celebrated-by-smile-foundations-swabhiman-programme\/","eventAttendanceMode":"https:\/\/schema.org\/OfflineEventAttendanceMode","eventStatus":"https:\/\/schema.org\/EventScheduled","startDate":"2018-08-01T08:00:00+05:30","endDate":"2018-08-07T17:00:00+05:30","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Delhi","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"performer":"Organization"}}
