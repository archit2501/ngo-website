As Mother Teresa has said, \u201cWe shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do\u201d, just sharing our smile with someone in need is a simple, but valuable gesture of empathy and kindness. By sensitizing children to the significance of the positive values one can derive from a smile, we hope to imbibe in them these lifelong values from an early age. Furthermore, these children are the carriers of change among their families and communities and will spread the message further and farther.<\/p>\n<p>Smile Foundation intends to take \u201cWorld Smile Day\u201d to an even larger scale by making it a national celebration of essential human values and bring together thousands of children and masses, so that empathy and kindness can become the strongholds of our society.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"world-smile-day-celebrated-at-mission-education-centres","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/world-smile-me.jpg","id":44244,"extension":"jpg","width":1926,"height":600,"filesize":"148062","sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":93,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"11031","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/world-smile-me-300x93.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"79151","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/world-smile-me-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"8139","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/world-smile-me-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":239,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"49651","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/world-smile-me-768x239.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":479,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"149765","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/world-smile-me-1536x479.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":374,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"102062","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/world-smile-me-1200x374.jpg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2016-11-15 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2016","month":"11","day":"15","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2016-11-15 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2016","month":"11","day":"15","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2016-11-14 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2016","month":"11","day":"14","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2016-11-15 18:29:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2016","month":"11","day":"15","hour":"18","minutes":"29","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Workshop &amp; Events","slug":"workshops-events","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":9,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":650,"filter":"raw","id":9,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/9","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":43895,"author":"1","status":"publish","date":"2022-09-26 18:53:28","date_utc":"2022-09-26 13:23:28","modified":"2022-09-26 18:53:28","modified_utc":"2022-09-26 13:23:28","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/delhi\/","venue":"Delhi","slug":"delhi","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Delhi","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43895","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43895"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"World Smile Day celebrated at Mission Education centres","description":"&lt;p&gt;Smile Foundation\u2019s initiative \u201cWorld Smile Day\u201d was celebrated by children from our Mission Education centres in Delhi.
