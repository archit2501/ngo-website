This festival is a vibrant celebration of good cinema, diverse cultures, and universal values from around the world.<\/p>\n<p>SIFFCY film festival presented a curated selection of over 150 critically acclaimed films from more than 50 countries. The films captivated an audience of over 50,000 children at the prestigious Sirifort Auditorium Complex in New Delhi. Additionally, the festival is simultaneously screened at 50+ different locations across India, reaching out to a wider audience.<\/p>\n<p>But SIFFCY is not just about watching films; it&#8217;s an enriching experience for children. They have the opportunity to learn from some of the most creative minds in the film industry. Through engaging workshops, inspiring masterclasses, and thought-provoking panel discussions, children gained insights into the art and craft of filmmaking. They also had the chance to interact with industry professionals, broadening their horizons and nurturing their artistic aspirations.<\/p>\n<p>Smile Foundation&#8217;s SIFFCY Film Festival goes beyond entertainment. It is an initiative to sensitize children and youth by showcasing hand-picked, high-quality films. These films cover a wide range of topics, including social and economic equality, gender equality, environmental issues, family values, friendship, aspirations, dreams, self-confidence, and the significance of education. By presenting these films, SIFFCY aims to inspire young minds, ignite conversations, and foster a deeper understanding of global issues and diverse cultures.<\/p>\n<p>SIFFCY is a platform that encourages creativity, imagination, and empathy among children and youth. It promotes the values of inclusivity, respect, and compassion through the universal language of cinema. As children immerse themselves in the captivating stories on screen, they are inspired to reflect, question, and embrace positive change in their own lives and communities.<\/p>\n<p>The next edition of SIFFCY will be a grand one as we will be celebrating 10 years of this children&#8217;s film festival- #SIFFCY2024.
