The two-day \u2018Learning Fest\u2019 was organized for 170 teenage girls.<\/p>\n<p>These girls have excelled in their studies, despite living in poverty. Each one of them has received scholarships to complete their education under Smile Foundation&#8217;s Swabhiman programme.<\/p>\n<p>The two-day \u2018Learning Fest\u2019 was organised for these girls to help them explore themselves holistically and shape their own life. With a view of making them self-aware, confident and take full charge of their own development, interactive and self exploration workshops were conducted to empower them with various life skills. They were helped by experts to develop their personality, interpersonal relationships and studies. The Learning Fest 2019 witnessed an assortment of valuable sessions based on career counselling, effective communication, healthy eating\/nutrition, adolescent reproductive &amp; sexual health, first aid and yoga.<\/p>\n<p>The girls were thrilled to meet and interact with successful women professionals like pilots and policewomen among others, who not only opened up about their challenges, but also encouraged the scholars to pursue their dreams. The cultural evening brought applauses and a new wave of confidence added flame to the fire.<\/p>\n<p>Most of these girls, who have remained silent up till now, have undergone a transformative experience and discovered solidarity with many others who have also charted their independent path through Swabhiman Scholarship.<\/p>\n<p>To look at these girls after the end of the fest, was like looking at future women leaders.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"fourth-edition-of-learning-fest-concludes","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/fourth-edition-1314jun19-1.jpg","id":57158,"extension":"jpg","width":1926,"height":600,"filesize":"190571","sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":93,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"12019","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/fourth-edition-1314jun19-1-300x93.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"91945","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/fourth-edition-1314jun19-1-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"9067","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/fourth-edition-1314jun19-1-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":239,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"56819","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/fourth-edition-1314jun19-1-768x239.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":479,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"177471","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/fourth-edition-1314jun19-1-1536x479.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":374,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"119991","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/fourth-edition-1314jun19-1-1200x374.jpg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2019-06-13 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"06","day":"13","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2019-06-14 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"06","day":"14","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2019-06-12 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"06","day":"12","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2019-06-14 18:29:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"06","day":"14","hour":"18","minutes":"29","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Swabhiman Happenings","slug":"swabhiman-happenings","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":50,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":127,"filter":"raw","id":50,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/50","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":43895,"author":"1","status":"publish","date":"2022-09-26 18:53:28","date_utc":"2022-09-26 13:23:28","modified":"2022-09-26 18:53:28","modified_utc":"2022-09-26 13:23:28","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/delhi\/","venue":"Delhi","slug":"delhi","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Delhi","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43895","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43895"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Fourth edition of Learning Fest concludes","description":"&lt;p&gt;The fourth edition of the Swabhiman Learning Fest, which is a two day residential camp for the scholars of Swabhiman concluded on the 14th of June 2019.
