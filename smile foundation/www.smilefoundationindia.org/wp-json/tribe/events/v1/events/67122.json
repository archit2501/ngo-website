Children tend to work harder and engage more in classroom if a teacher is attentive towards the academic needs of the child.<\/p>\n<p>An engaging classroom is important the degree of attention, curiosity, interest, optimism, and passion that students show when they are learning or being taught, extends to the level of motivation they have to learn and progress in their education.<\/p>\n<p>Keeping both these things in mind teachers were sensitized about various ways to keep the children engaged and inculcate new ways in the teaching methodology to keep the classroom teaching-learning process more interesting.<\/p>\n<p>Smile Foundation visits various privileged schools across India and conducts engaging sessions for the young minds, under CFC programme.
