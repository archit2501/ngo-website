A workshop was conducted for the children of a school in Delhi regarding the same. The children were told about the various types of touches and how they should immediately alert an elder if any such incidents happen. The counseling was important because many a times children are intimidated by adults and are scared to speak up. The children were also asked to keep a look out for other young children who might be a target for any such incidents.<\/p>\n<p>Under the Child For Child programme, Smile Foundation visits various schools and conducts engaging sessions for the young minds. It sensitizes children towards various causes and let them realize their privileged status.<\/p>\n<p>CFC currently reaches out to nearly one million privileged children in 900 schools spread across 417 districts of India, every year. In addition, their parents and teachers are also involved in the process. The programme has today reached out to each part of India with the exception of Lakshadweep.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"workshop-on-value-education-for-school-children","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/wves-children.jpg","id":67296,"extension":"jpg","width":1926,"height":600,"filesize":107268,"sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":93,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":8917,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/wves-children-300x93.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":55019,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/wves-children-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":5327,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/wves-children-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":239,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":35829,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/wves-children-768x239.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":479,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":100204,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/wves-children-1536x479.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":374,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":70231,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/wves-children-1200x374.jpg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2018-09-10 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"09","day":"10","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2018-09-10 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"09","day":"10","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2018-09-09 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"09","day":"09","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2018-09-10 18:29:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"09","day":"10","hour":"18","minutes":"29","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"CFC Happenings","slug":"cfc-happenings","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":68,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":188,"filter":"raw","id":68,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/68","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":43895,"author":"1","status":"publish","date":"2022-09-26 18:53:28","date_utc":"2022-09-26 13:23:28","modified":"2022-09-26 18:53:28","modified_utc":"2022-09-26 13:23:28","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/delhi\/","venue":"Delhi","slug":"delhi","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Delhi","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43895","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43895"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Workshop on value education for school children","description":"&lt;p&gt;It is very important to teach to be alert of as number of things like inappropriate gestures, touches and speaking up about any such incidents.
