This activity was a part of &#8216;Plant a 6&#8217; initiative by KKR &amp; Juhi&#8217;s Citizens for Tomorrow campaign that kick-started last year with a aim to plant a tree for every 6 hit by KKR in their home-ground Kolkata. KKR has been in the forefront of taking the eco-friendly route &amp; stopped the sale of plastic flags last year &amp; which continued this year &amp; has also installed dustbins throughout the stadium.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking about the event KKR co-owner Juhi Chawla said, &#8220;It was good fun. We had some children from Smile Foundation. We were joking, laughing and then doing something good. We must be doing a lot more of this, but we have made a beginning. It&#8217;s not just about planting the trees, but also taking care of them,&#8221; said Juhi, who&#8217;s grown a &#8220;green mind&#8221; now. &#8220;I only want to see green everywhere,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>Smile Foundation is an NGO in India directly benefitting over 600,000 children and their families every year, through more than 250 live welfare projects on education, healthcare, livelihood and women empowerment, in over 950 remote villages and slums across 25 states of India.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"team-kolkata-knight-riders-plant-trees-with-smile-foundation","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/team-kolkata-knight.jpg","id":43934,"extension":"jpg","width":952,"height":405,"filesize":"79779","sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":128,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"13993","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/team-kolkata-knight-300x128.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"8929","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/team-kolkata-knight-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":327,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"64624","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/team-kolkata-knight-768x327.jpg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2018-10-12 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"10","day":"12","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2018-10-12 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"10","day":"12","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2018-10-11 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"10","day":"11","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2018-10-12 18:29:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"10","day":"12","hour":"18","minutes":"29","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Workshop &amp; Events","slug":"workshops-events","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":9,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":650,"filter":"raw","id":9,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/9","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":43936,"author":"1","status":"publish","date":"2022-09-26 19:15:57","date_utc":"2022-09-26 13:45:57","modified":"2022-09-26 19:15:57","modified_utc":"2022-09-26 13:45:57","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/kolkata\/","venue":"Kolkata","slug":"kolkata","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Kolkata","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43936","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43936"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Team Kolkata Knight Riders plant trees with Smile Foundation","description":"&lt;p&gt;Team Kolkata Knight Riders planted trees with Smile Foundation children on the 12th of October 2018 under the Plant a Tree initiative.
