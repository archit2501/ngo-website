However, in most parts of the world, it remains a taboo and is rarely talked about. Cultural practices and taboos around menstruation negatively impact the lives of women and girls, and reinforce gender inequities and exclusion. Moreover, studies have proved a direct link between poor menstrual hygiene and urinary or reproductive tract infections and other illnesses.<\/p>\n<p class=\"partnertext\" align=\"justify\">A three-day workshop on the issue of menstrual hygiene and safe menstrual practice was held by Swabhiman programme for its community health educators and health volunteers during March 16-21. Around 123 health educators and volunteers in the age group of 12- 42 years, from Swabhiman centres &#8216;Adhaar&#8217; (Shashi Garden), &#8216;Sahyogita Samaj Vikas Sansthan&#8217; (Chhattarpur), and &#8216;Health &amp; Care Society&#8217; (Indira Camp) actively participated in the activity, conducted by Dr. Uzma Bano.<\/p>\n<p class=\"partnertext\" align=\"justify\">Discussions veered on orienting the health educators and volunteers on good menstrual hygienic practices such as use of sanitary napkins; washing and cleaning; how to dispose sanitary napkins, followed by precautions to be taken during the period and dietary habits, so, as to enable them to lead a healthy reproductive life in future.<\/p>\n<p class=\"partnertext\" align=\"justify\">Attending the workshop, Durga, a participant at the Indira Camp, stated, &#8220;The workshop has sensitised me on various complications arising out of lack of menstrual hygiene, namely RTI and infertility. I will be more conscious about maintaining hygiene in future and will further spread the message among other women in my neighbourhood.&#8221;<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"workshop-on-menstrual-hygiene-to-spread-awareness-on-safe-menstrual-practices","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/menstrual-hygiene-1.jpg","id":45006,"extension":"jpg","width":1926,"height":600,"filesize":"139191","sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":93,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"11094","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/menstrual-hygiene-1-300x93.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"73439","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/menstrual-hygiene-1-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"7778","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/menstrual-hygiene-1-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":239,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"47818","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/menstrual-hygiene-1-768x239.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":479,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"131733","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/menstrual-hygiene-1-1536x479.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":374,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"93363","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/menstrual-hygiene-1-1200x374.jpg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2013-03-16 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2013","month":"03","day":"16","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2013-03-21 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2013","month":"03","day":"21","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2013-03-15 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2013","month":"03","day":"15","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2013-03-21 18:29:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2013","month":"03","day":"21","hour":"18","minutes":"29","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Workshop &amp; Events","slug":"workshops-events","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":9,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":650,"filter":"raw","id":9,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/9","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":43895,"author":"1","status":"publish","date":"2022-09-26 18:53:28","date_utc":"2022-09-26 13:23:28","modified":"2022-09-26 18:53:28","modified_utc":"2022-09-26 13:23:28","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/delhi\/","venue":"Delhi","slug":"delhi","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Delhi","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43895","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43895"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Workshop on menstrual hygiene to spread awareness on safe menstrual practices","description":"&lt;p&gt;Menstruation is a natural part of the reproductive cycle.
