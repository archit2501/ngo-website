The two-day \u2018Learning Fest\u2019 was organised for 130 girls.<\/p>\n<p>These girls have excelled in their studies, despite living in poverty. Each one of them has received scholarships to complete their education under Smile Foundation&#8217;s Swabhiman programme.<\/p>\n<p>The two-day \u2018Learning Fest\u2019 was organised for these girls to help them explore themselves holistically and shape their own life. With a view of making them self-aware, confident and take full charge of their own development, interactive and self exploration workshops were conducted to empower them with various life skills. They were helped by experts to develop their personality, interpersonal relationships and studies.<\/p>\n<p>The conclusion of the camp witnessed relatively confident, self-relying and optimistic girls!<\/p>\n<p>Swabhiman, meaning self-respect in English, was initiated in 2005 to address these challenges through a simple yet effective approach. The programme is specifically aimed at realization of both individual and collective self-esteem and inner strength for marginalised and socially excluded women and adolescent girls through innovative community practices.<\/p>\n<p>Smile Foundation is a national level development organisation directly benefitting over 400,000 children and their families every year, through more than 200 live welfare projects on education, healthcare, livelihood and women empowerment, in over 950 remote villages and slums across 25 states of India.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"third-learning-fest-for-swabhiman-scholars-concludes","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/third-learning.jpg","id":57280,"extension":"jpg","width":1926,"height":600,"filesize":"195076","sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":93,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"11796","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/third-learning-300x93.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"87348","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/third-learning-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"9130","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/third-learning-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":239,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"54405","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/third-learning-768x239.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":479,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"166162","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/third-learning-1536x479.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":374,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"113079","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/third-learning-1200x374.jpg"}}},"all_day":false,"start_date":"2018-06-06 08:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"06","day":"06","hour":"08","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2018-06-07 17:00:00","end_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"06","day":"07","hour":"17","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_start_date":"2018-06-06 02:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"06","day":"06","hour":"02","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2018-06-07 11:30:00","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"06","day":"07","hour":"11","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Swabhiman Happenings","slug":"swabhiman-happenings","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":50,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":127,"filter":"raw","id":50,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/50","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":43895,"author":"1","status":"publish","date":"2022-09-26 18:53:28","date_utc":"2022-09-26 13:23:28","modified":"2022-09-26 18:53:28","modified_utc":"2022-09-26 13:23:28","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/delhi\/","venue":"Delhi","slug":"delhi","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Delhi","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43895","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43895"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Third Learning Fest for Swabhiman scholars concludes","description":"&lt;p&gt;The third edition of the Swabhiman Learning Fest, which is a two day residential camp for the scholars of Swabhiman concluded on the 7th of June 2018.
