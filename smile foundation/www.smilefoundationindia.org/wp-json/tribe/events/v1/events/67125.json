Children on their journey to adulthood are often confused with the massive biological changes they are going through at this stage in their lives. There is a need for guidance, especially from those who can help them better understand their own mindsets, the rapid hormonal changes and its impact. Students at this age, are usually also found battling with peer pressure and seek direction on how to handle them.<\/p>\n<p>Looking at various opportunities available for adolescent kids at this time in their lives, Subhash Montessori School in Madhya Pradesh invited the Child For Child team of Smile Foundation to spread awareness among its students regarding Substance Abuse and Creating Self Esteem. Ms. Richa Sahay from Team Smile conducted two hour workshops for each of these activities. Addressing a total of 200 students, she emphasized about the wisdom to use gadgets, gave clarity on how to combat fear and develop self-confidence. Filled with small exercises and thinking activities, the children were given ample time to analyze various behaviors and choose the best for themselves.<\/p>\n<p>This interactive experience became quite insightful for them, as their interest was reflected in their enthusiastic participation in raising various questions and observations from time to time. All in all, the students took back with them a whole new level of self-confidence by the end of the workshops.<\/p>\n<p>Smile Foundation visits various privileged schools across India and conducts engaging sessions for the young minds, under CFC programme. Smile Foundation believes along with education of children sensitization in various causes, value systems should be ushered to realize their importance in growing up as responsible citizens of the country.<\/p>\n<p>CFC currently reaches out to nearly one million privileged children in 900 schools spread across 417 districts of India, every year. In addition, their parents and teachers are also involved in the process. The programme has today reached out to each part of India with the exception of Lakshadweep.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"workshop-on-substance-abuse-and-creating-self-esteem-for-children-conducted","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/workshops-18oct19.jpg","id":67126,"extension":"jpg","width":1926,"height":600,"filesize":97249,"sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":93,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":9135,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/workshops-18oct19-300x93.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":59323,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/workshops-18oct19-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":6324,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/workshops-18oct19-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":239,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":38241,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/workshops-18oct19-768x239.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":479,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":108650,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/workshops-18oct19-1536x479.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":374,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":75610,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/workshops-18oct19-1200x374.jpg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2019-10-18 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"10","day":"18","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2019-10-18 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"10","day":"18","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2019-10-17 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"10","day":"17","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2019-10-18 18:29:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"10","day":"18","hour":"18","minutes":"29","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"CFC Value Shop","slug":"cfc-value-shop","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":69,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":18,"filter":"raw","id":69,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/69","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":44487,"author":"1","status":"publish","date":"2022-09-27 19:08:50","date_utc":"2022-09-27 13:38:50","modified":"2022-09-27 19:08:50","modified_utc":"2022-09-27 13:38:50","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/madhya-pradesh\/","venue":"Madhya Pradesh","slug":"madhya-pradesh","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Madhya Pradesh","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=44487","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=44487"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Workshop on Substance Abuse and Creating Self Esteem for children conducted","description":"&lt;p&gt;Adolescence is a tender age.
