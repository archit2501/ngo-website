The drive was conducted under the Child for Child programme of Smile Foundation. Children often do not attend school because they do not own proper clothing as a result their learning process is hindered and they also fall short of attendance. To curb such problems the students of the school were provided with good clothes.<\/p>\n<p>Under Child for Child programme, Smile Foundation visits various schools and conducts engaging sessions for the young minds. It sensitizes children towards various causes and let them realize their privileged status.<\/p>\n<p>CFC currently reaches out to nearly one million privileged children in 900 schools spread across 417 districts of India, every year. In addition, their parents and teachers are also involved in the process. The programme has today reached out to each part of India with the exception of Lakshadweep.<\/p>\n<p>Smile Foundation is a national level development organisation directly benefitting over 400,000 children and their families every year, through more than 200 live welfare projects on education, healthcare, livelihood and women empowerment, in over 950 remote villages and slums across 25 states of India.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"dress-distribution-for-school-children-in-nagpur","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/dress.jpg","id":67347,"extension":"jpg","width":1926,"height":600,"filesize":157039,"sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":93,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":9862,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/dress-300x93.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":69541,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/dress-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":7329,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/dress-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":239,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":43303,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/dress-768x239.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":479,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":135026,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/dress-1536x479.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":374,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":90948,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/dress-1200x374.jpg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2017-07-15 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"07","day":"15","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2017-07-15 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"07","day":"15","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2017-07-14 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"07","day":"14","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2017-07-15 18:29:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"07","day":"15","hour":"18","minutes":"29","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"CFC Happenings","slug":"cfc-happenings","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":68,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":188,"filter":"raw","id":68,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/68","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":44702,"author":"1","status":"publish","date":"2022-09-29 17:22:46","date_utc":"2022-09-29 11:52:46","modified":"2022-09-29 17:22:46","modified_utc":"2022-09-29 11:52:46","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/nagpur\/","venue":"Nagpur","slug":"nagpur","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Nagpur","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=44702","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=44702"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Dress distribution for school children in Nagpur","description":"&lt;p&gt;A dress distribution event was conducted at a school for the school children at Nagpur on 15th July, 2017.
