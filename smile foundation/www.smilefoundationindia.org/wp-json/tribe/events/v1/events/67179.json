There is a need to increase the awareness regarding CSA and sensitize the prime persons in a child\u2019s life viz. parents, teachers and peers, who can bring a definite change in the intervention by reporting it early. There are many unreported and unnoticed cases.<\/p>\n<p>A workshop on child sexual abuse was conducted in a school in Mohali on the 27th of May 2019. 200 parents attended the workshop conducted by the Child for Child programme of Smile Foundation.
