The girls were taught simple ways of self defense and they were also spoken to about tackling situations in which they found themselves to be under any kind of harassment. The safety of the girl child should be given maximum priority and hence the workshop was seen as a boon to the gilrs who often have to travel away from their homes for studies and work.<\/p>\n<p>Smile Foundation is an NGO in India directly benefitting over 600,000 children and their families every year, through more than 250 live welfare projects on education, healthcare, livelihood and women empowerment, in over 950 remote villages and slums across 25 states of India.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"self-defense-workshop-conducted-for-girls","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/self-defense.jpg","id":57374,"extension":"jpg","width":1926,"height":600,"filesize":"163803","sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":93,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"10029","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/self-defense-300x93.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"70307","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/self-defense-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"7337","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/self-defense-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":239,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"43942","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/self-defense-768x239.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":479,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"136933","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/self-defense-1536x479.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":374,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"91676","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/self-defense-1200x374.jpg"}}},"all_day":false,"start_date":"2018-02-07 08:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"02","day":"07","hour":"08","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2018-02-08 17:00:00","end_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"02","day":"08","hour":"17","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_start_date":"2018-02-07 02:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"02","day":"07","hour":"02","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2018-02-08 11:30:00","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"02","day":"08","hour":"11","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Swabhiman Happenings","slug":"swabhiman-happenings","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":50,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":127,"filter":"raw","id":50,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/50","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":43895,"author":"1","status":"publish","date":"2022-09-26 18:53:28","date_utc":"2022-09-26 13:23:28","modified":"2022-09-26 18:53:28","modified_utc":"2022-09-26 13:23:28","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/delhi\/","venue":"Delhi","slug":"delhi","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Delhi","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43895","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43895"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Self defense workshop conducted for girls","description":"&lt;p&gt;A self defense training camp was conducted for the girls of Shri Ram J.
