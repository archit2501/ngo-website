With over 22 years of experience in alternative therapies and energy medicine, Mr. Singh brings a wealth of knowledge to the workshop.<\/p>\n<p>Medical professionals now widely recognize the significant impact of emotions on our overall health. Stress, triggered by negative emotions such as grief, guilt, and fear, is known to contribute to a range of health conditions, from minor ailments to severe diseases. It is clear that a key aspect of a healthy life lies in cultivating happiness and self-arising joy.<\/p>\n<p>The human body has the innate capability to flush out toxins or chemical reactions within 9 seconds. However, due to our surroundings or circumstances, our emotions can become blocked, hindering the proper flow of cardiac and life energies within our energy body. This blockage can lead to health problems, relationship issues, and career challenges. For instance, unresolved anger from past events can manifest as liver problems and acidity, fear of change may result in knee problems, and prolonged grief can impact the lungs. Emotions such as panic can even affect blood sugar levels.<\/p>\n<p>When emotions remain stuck within us, we find ourselves trapped in the past. Releasing these blocked emotions allows us to return to the present moment, experience happiness, and regain our energy. Remarkably, once emotions are unstuck, the body and mind can repair themselves with minimal or no medical intervention. The Emotion Deletion Method (EDM) offers an astonishing approach to releasing stuck emotions, often yielding nearly instantaneous results.<\/p>\n<p>During this workshop, participants:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learned the fundamentals of the EDM<\/li>\n<li>Gained insights into the origins of our experiences<\/li>\n<li>Acquired a method to identify and verify the emotions that debilitate our health in the present moment<\/li>\n<li>Engaged in the practice of deleting blocked emotions within their systems<\/li>\n<li>Had the opportunity to ask questions and seek clarifications<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The EDM is an incredibly powerful system that can be learned by anyone, including children. Teachers stand to benefit greatly from participating in this program, as the Emotional Well-Being workshop offers:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased teacher efficacy<\/li>\n<li>A better understanding of
