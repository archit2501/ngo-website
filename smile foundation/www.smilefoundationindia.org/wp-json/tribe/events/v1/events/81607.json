The campaign aptly reinforces the idea that &#8220;doing is the new learning,&#8221; with today&#8217;s kids exemplifying this transformative shift and using technology as a reliable enabler to success.<\/p>\n<p>In collaboration with VMLY&amp;R, the campaign aligns seamlessly with Dell&#8217;s #PC4Education initiative, celebrating the learning ethos of students. Whether it&#8217;s achieving success, embracing failure, or harnessing their skills to create a positive impact on society, this campaign cherishes and empowers the spirit of young learners. With this initiative, Dell reaffirms its commitment to making education accessible, innovative, and empowering for students worldwide.<\/p>\n<p>As an extension of its new campaign, &#8216;Doing is the New Learning&#8217;, Dell has collaborated with 88 schools in seven cities, along with Smile Foundation, to bring forth a special series called &#8216;Doing Good.&#8217; The aim is to showcase the stories of students who are actively making a positive difference in their communities.<\/p>\n<p>The primary objective is to inspire young minds to think beyond themselves and utilize technology as a catalyst for creating a meaningful impact in the world. Through awareness sessions held in over 40 privileged schools, the flagship campaign, Shiksha Na Ruke is brought to the forefront.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Dell conducts sessions on the importance of technology, enlightening children about its transformative power. As part of their commitment, Dell has provided stationery items to approximately 400 children, enabling them to pursue their educational journey effectively.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, Dell has contributed five personal computers to five different centers. This will significantly enhance the educational experience for the students.<\/p>\n<p>To amplify the impact of the Shiksha Na Ruke campaign, Dell has leveraged its strong digital presence by promoting the cause across its social media platforms. With the campaign gaining approximately 18 million views, the message of uninterrupted education is spreading far and wide.<\/p>\n<p>Smile Foundation has provided access to ME (Mission Education) centers across seven cities, including Delhi, Gurgaon, Bangalore, Chandigarh, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Chennai. These centers serve as valuable educational resources for children, empowering them with the necessary tools to thrive academically.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"dell-collaborates-with-smile-foundation-for-doing-good-series","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/DSC04878-scaled.jpg","id":81608,"extension":"jpg","width":2560,"height":1707,"filesize":566319,"sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":19725,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/DSC04878-300x200.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":683,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":137435,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/DSC04878-1024x683.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":9178,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/DSC04878-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":512,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":86685,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/DSC04878-768x512.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":1024,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":257394,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/DSC04878-1536x1024.jpg"},"2048x2048":{"width":2048,"height":1365,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":403017,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/DSC04878-2048x1365.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":800,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":176883,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/DSC04878-1200x800.jpg"},"twentytwenty-fullscreen":{"width":1980,"height":1320,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":381660,"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/DSC04878-1980x1320.jpg"}},"original_image":"DSC04878.jpg"},"all_day":false,"start_date":"2023-03-27 08:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2023","month":"03","day":"27","hour":"08","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2023-03-27 17:00:00","end_date_details":{"year":"2023","month":"03","day":"27","hour":"17","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_start_date":"2023-03-27 02:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2023","month":"03","day":"27","hour":"02","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2023-03-27 11:30:00","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2023","month":"03","day":"27","hour":"11","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Workshop &amp; Events","slug":"workshops-events","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":9,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":650,"filter":"raw","id":9,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/9","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":81610,"author":"6","status":"publish","date":"2023-06-26 14:39:40","date_utc":"2023-06-26 09:09:40","modified":"2023-06-26 14:39:40","modified_utc":"2023-06-26 09:09:40","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/multiple-centres-across-india\/","venue":"Multiple Centres Across India","slug":"multiple-centres-across-india","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Multiple Centres Across India","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=81610","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=81610"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Dell Collaborates with Smile Foundation for &#8216;Doing Good&#8217; Series","description":"&lt;p&gt;Dell Technologies proudly unveiled it\\'s latest \\'Back to School\\' campaign in March 2023 in Delhi, emphasizing the vital role of PCs in delivering exceptional learning experiences.
