We may be in the present completely focused on making it from one day to the other while battling Covid -19, but we have to always bear in mind that there is a segment of the population that is very vulnerable whenever an epidemic engulfs a nation. Child Labor is one of the most important and prevalent problems in today\u2019s society.<\/p>\n<p>At Smile Foundation a campaign was designed around the theme of Anti Child Labour to encourage children who are privileged, to think about their underprivileged counterparts. The children came up with Essays, Poems &amp; Posters revolving around the theme of Anti Child Labour. The campaign commenced on the 26th of April and concluded on the 1st of May. May Day is commemorated as Labour Day which is an important day to spread the message that Child Labour is Child Abuse, For which there is No Excuse with this campaign. The participating children researched, pondered and let their creative juices flow while expressing their thoughts on Child Labour. Ms. Nickunj Malik, was the juror for essays. She is a noted columnist &amp; humourist and associated with Khaleej Times, Dubai Star, Bahrain Tribune &amp; many noted international Newspapers &amp; magazines for the past 28 years.<\/p>\n<p>For Poems Ms. Shipra Verma judged the entries, she ranked amongst the Top 100 best contemporary English poets of the world, 2017. She has published a collection of Hindi Poems &#8211; &#8220;Akinchan Kavitayen&#8221; &amp; a collection of English poems &#8220;Ravine and Peak\u201d and \u201cChhappan Bhog\u201d a book of Hindi poems in. She was conferred with Rashtrabhasha Parishad Award, 2003.<\/p>\n<p>As a juror for Posters we had Ms. Purnima Satheesan who is a consultant designer &amp; works extensively with children with special needs.
