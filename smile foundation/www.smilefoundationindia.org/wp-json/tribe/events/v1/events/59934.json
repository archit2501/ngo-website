Launched in June 2015, the project has already benefitted a population of over 6000 people. Living in one of the most backward districts, the people of these villages make a living from small time farming. The land has a history of frequent droughts, often leading to severe food and health crisis. Also, there is an acute deficiency of professional and trained doctors due to the remoteness, making quality healthcare an urgent need. Smile Foundation has partnered with Odisha Voluntary Health Association (OVHA) for this Smile on Wheels project, which is being supported by TATA Trusts. The project will complement the existing government facilities, form linkages with community health workers and help make quality healthcare accessible to the villagers.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"smiling-through-kalahandi","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/smiling-through-kalahandi.jpg","id":59936,"extension":"jpg","width":1926,"height":600,"filesize":"70831","sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":93,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"6529","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/smiling-through-kalahandi-300x93.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"37985","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/smiling-through-kalahandi-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"7892","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/smiling-through-kalahandi-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":239,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"24921","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/smiling-through-kalahandi-768x239.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":479,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"67960","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/smiling-through-kalahandi-1536x479.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":374,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"47866","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/smiling-through-kalahandi-1200x374.jpg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2015-11-23 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2015","month":"11","day":"23","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2015-11-23 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2015","month":"11","day":"23","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2015-11-22 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2015","month":"11","day":"22","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2015-11-23 18:29:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2015","month":"11","day":"23","hour":"18","minutes":"29","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Health and awareness activities for underprivileged children &amp; families","slug":"health-and-awareness-activities-for-underprivileged-children-families","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":53,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":102,"filter":"raw","id":53,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/53","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":56681,"author":"2","status":"publish","date":"2022-11-08 13:10:09","date_utc":"2022-11-08 07:40:09","modified":"2022-11-08 13:10:09","modified_utc":"2022-11-08 07:40:09","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/orissa\/","venue":"Orissa","slug":"orissa","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Orissa","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=56681","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=56681"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Smiling through Kalahandi","description":"&lt;p&gt;People from 42 of the remotest of villages in Kalahandi district in Odisha now have healthcare coming right at their doorsteps.
