Hand washing kits were also distributed to the children and the children were also given a demo of how to wash hands properly.<\/p>\n<p>Smile on Wheels programme at present has 34 operational projects in 265 remote villages and urban slums across India, directly benefitting over 400,000 lives in a year.<\/p>\n<p>Smile Foundation is a national level development organisation directly benefitting over 400,000 children and their families every year, through more than 200 live welfare projects on education, healthcare, livelihood and women empowerment, in over 950 remote villages and slums across 25 states of India.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"washing-hands-and-keeping-away-from-diseases","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/washing-hand.jpg","id":59291,"extension":"jpg","width":1926,"height":600,"filesize":"200038","sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":93,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"11339","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/washing-hand-300x93.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"83158","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/washing-hand-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"8343","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/washing-hand-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":239,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"51515","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/washing-hand-768x239.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":479,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"162790","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/washing-hand-1536x479.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":374,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"109082","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/washing-hand-1200x374.jpg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2018-06-07 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"06","day":"07","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2018-06-07 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"06","day":"07","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2018-06-06 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"06","day":"06","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2018-06-07 18:29:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"06","day":"07","hour":"18","minutes":"29","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Health and awareness activities for underprivileged children &amp; families","slug":"health-and-awareness-activities-for-underprivileged-children-families","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":53,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":102,"filter":"raw","id":53,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/53","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":43906,"author":"1","status":"publish","date":"2022-09-26 18:59:25","date_utc":"2022-09-26 13:29:25","modified":"2022-09-26 18:59:25","modified_utc":"2022-09-26 13:29:25","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/gurugram\/","venue":"Gurugram","slug":"gurugram","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Gurugram","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43906","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43906"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Washing hands and keeping away from diseases","description":"&lt;p&gt;Hand washing is an important part of our daily activities.
