It is important to keep it clean and green. Recently, children from a Mission Education centre in Mumbai took to one of the beaches in the city and cleaned it with the help of the teachers and other volunteers. The motto was to keep the city beautiful and keep the beach clean. Children when taught about basic things like caring for the nature grow up to be more responsible to our primary care giver, Mother Nature. The children had much fun working in groups and cleaned the beaches.<\/p>\n<p>Mission Education is a national level programme of Smile Foundation, which is committed to providing basic education and healthcare to underprivileged children.<\/p>\n<p>Smile Foundation is an NGO in India directly benefitting over 600,000 children and their families every year, through more than 250 live welfare projects on education, healthcare, livelihood and women empowerment, in over 950 remote villages and slums across 25 states of India.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"planting-trees-for-a-cleaner-environment-2","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/beachcleaning.jpg","id":59190,"extension":"jpg","width":1926,"height":600,"filesize":"195262","sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":93,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"9348","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/beachcleaning-300x93.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"74335","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/beachcleaning-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"7384","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/beachcleaning-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":239,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"44220","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/beachcleaning-768x239.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":479,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"154159","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/beachcleaning-1536x479.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":374,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"99820","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/beachcleaning-1200x374.jpg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2018-06-22 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"06","day":"22","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2018-06-22 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"06","day":"22","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2018-06-21 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"06","day":"21","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2018-06-22 18:29:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"06","day":"22","hour":"18","minutes":"29","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Educational activities &amp; happenings for underprivileged children","slug":"educational-activities-happenings-for-underprivileged-children","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":51,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":216,"filter":"raw","id":51,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/51","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":43910,"author":"1","status":"publish","date":"2022-09-26 19:00:31","date_utc":"2022-09-26 13:30:31","modified":"2022-09-26 19:00:31","modified_utc":"2022-09-26 13:30:31","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/mumbai\/","venue":"Mumbai","slug":"mumbai","country":"India","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Mumbai","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","addressCountry":"India"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43910","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43910"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Planting trees for a cleaner environment","description":"&lt;p&gt;It is our duty to take care of the nature and nurture it as it does for us.
