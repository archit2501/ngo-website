The first place visited was National Science Center where the scholars explored a variety of exhibits through the various sections like Human Biology gallery, Fun Science Library, Heritage and Dinosaur gallery, Nuclear Science gallery, Revolution gallery, etc. The Center is a platform for showcasing the varied features of the world of science. The scholars tried the various hands-on exhibits that helped them understand the many principles of science used in day to day life.<\/p>\n<p>The next place the scholars visited was Humayun\u2019s Tomb. The scholars explored the whole walled enclosure, the garden squares and the dome structure. The scholars acknowledged the effort for organizing the interesting visit to such places as they were able to learn about varied things.<\/p>\n<p>Swabhiman, meaning self-respect in English, was initiated in 2005 to address these challenges through a simple yet effective approach. The programme is specifically aimed at realization of both individual and collective self-esteem and inner strength for marginalised and socially excluded women and adolescent girls through innovative community practices.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"exposure-visit-conducted-for-swabhiman-scholars","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/scholars.jpg","id":57380,"extension":"jpg","width":1926,"height":600,"filesize":"118495","sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":93,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"9273","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/scholars-300x93.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"60977","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/scholars-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"7209","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/scholars-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":239,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"39025","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/scholars-768x239.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":479,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"111537","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/scholars-1536x479.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":374,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"77874","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/scholars-1200x374.jpg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2017-12-20 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"12","day":"20","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2017-12-20 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"12","day":"20","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2017-12-19 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"12","day":"19","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2017-12-20 18:29:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"12","day":"20","hour":"18","minutes":"29","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Swabhiman Happenings","slug":"swabhiman-happenings","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":50,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":127,"filter":"raw","id":50,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/50","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":43895,"author":"1","status":"publish","date":"2022-09-26 18:53:28","date_utc":"2022-09-26 13:23:28","modified":"2022-09-26 18:53:28","modified_utc":"2022-09-26 13:23:28","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/delhi\/","venue":"Delhi","slug":"delhi","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Delhi","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43895","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43895"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Exposure visit conducted for Swabhiman Scholars","description":"&lt;p&gt;An exposure visit1 was organized for Swabhiman scholars on the 20th of December 2017.
