The cricketer interacted with the girls and inspired them to study and work hard. He also shared some interesting moments of his life and career with the children.<\/p>\n<p>He was greatly touched by the work that was being done by Smile Foundation and said,\u201d There are very few organizations which do commendable work in the field of education, Smile Foundation is one of them. It is a huge task to work with the children residing in the slums, giving them a good education. Educating the girl child and imparting skill based education is also a great milestone that Smile Foundation has been able to achieve. I wholeheartedly support Smile Foundation and its endeavors and will continue to do so in the future. I hope more people will join the cause with me which will greatly benefit many more children who cannot afford to go to school.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Smile Foundation is a national level development organisation directly benefitting over 400,000 children and their families every year, through more than 200 live welfare projects on education, healthcare, livelihood and women empowerment, in over 950 remote villages and slums across 25 states of India.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"virender-sehwag-inspires-children-from-smile-foundation","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/virender-sehwag.jpg","id":44155,"extension":"jpg","width":1926,"height":600,"filesize":"156399","sizes":{"medium":{"width":300,"height":93,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"10452","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/virender-sehwag-300x93.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":319,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"68850","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/virender-sehwag-1024x319.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"7149","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/virender-sehwag-150x150.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":239,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"43433","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/virender-sehwag-768x239.jpg"},"1536x1536":{"width":1536,"height":479,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"132481","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/virender-sehwag-1536x479.jpg"},"post-thumbnail":{"width":1200,"height":374,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"89622","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/virender-sehwag-1200x374.jpg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2017-08-04 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"08","day":"04","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2017-08-04 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"08","day":"04","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2017-08-03 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"08","day":"03","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2017-08-04 18:29:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"08","day":"04","hour":"18","minutes":"29","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"Asia\/Kolkata","timezone_abbr":"IST","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Workshop &amp; Events","slug":"workshops-events","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":9,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":650,"filter":"raw","id":9,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/9","collection":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":43895,"author":"1","status":"publish","date":"2022-09-26 18:53:28","date_utc":"2022-09-26 13:23:28","modified":"2022-09-26 18:53:28","modified_utc":"2022-09-26 13:23:28","url":"https:\/\/www.smilefoundationindia.org\/venue\/delhi\/","venue":"Delhi","slug":"delhi","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"Delhi","description":"","url":"","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43895","global_id_lineage":["www.smilefoundationindia.org?id=43895"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Virender Sehwag inspires children from Smile Foundation","description":"&lt;p&gt;Virender Sehwag the Internationally acclaimed former vice-captain of the Indian cricket team spent a day interacting with children from Smile Foundation.
