SUMMARY:Child for Child rolls out first-edition of Body Science Workshop in Delhi schools
DESCRIPTION:Smile Foundation’s Child for Child programme rolled out the first-edition of Body Science workshop on the 20th of April 2019. The Body Science workshop was the first edition of many such workshops which are being rolled out in Delhi NCR schools by Smile Foundation. The 2-hour workshop conducted for classes VI\, VII and VIII at CSKM School\, Chhattarpur\, Delhi on Saturday allowed young children to listen\, talk and think about body\, sex\, safety\, good touch-bad touch\, menstruation and many other sensitive subjects in a way that it lessened embarrassment\, educated and protected privacy. The educators from Parvarish also enacted various scenarios of issues the children encounter on regular basis\, to help them reflect\, discuss and find solutions. \n“Body or sex education has always been a difficult subject to teach not just in Delhi schools but across India\, more because of our socio-cultural realities which prohibits us to talk or discuss the subject openly. But in the current day context where molestation and rapes have come so much closer homes and schools\, it becomes important to talk to children about it and empower them with skills to fight it\, as and when required\,” said Vineet Vaidya\, head\, Child for Child initiative at the Smile Foundation. \n“It is very important at all students get the information they require and feel comfortable to ask questions. All our educators are experts at teaching body and sex education\, they encourage participants to get involved and make the workshop more interesting\, and interactive. We use tools like short films\, drama\, discussion and some classroom learning to disseminate information\,” he said.
