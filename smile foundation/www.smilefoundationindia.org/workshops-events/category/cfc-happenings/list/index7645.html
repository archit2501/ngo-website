SUMMARY:Teachers Workshop on Emotional Wellbeing in Bharti Public School
DESCRIPTION:An Emotional Wellbeing workshop was expertly facilitated by Ms. Meena Batra\, Advisor at CFC Smile Foundation\, and Mr. Amit Singh\, Founder of the Void Technique and Emotion Deletion Method in Bharti Public School on 22nd May 2023. With over 22 years of experience in alternative therapies and energy medicine\, Mr. Singh brings a wealth of knowledge to the workshop. \nMedical professionals now widely recognize the significant impact of emotions on our overall health. Stress\, triggered by negative emotions such as grief\, guilt\, and fear\, is known to contribute to a range of health conditions\, from minor ailments to severe diseases. It is clear that a key aspect of a healthy life lies in cultivating happiness and self-arising joy. \nThe human body has the innate capability to flush out toxins or chemical reactions within 9 seconds. However\, due to our surroundings or circumstances\, our emotions can become blocked\, hindering the proper flow of cardiac and life energies within our energy body. This blockage can lead to health problems\, relationship issues\, and career challenges. For instance\, unresolved anger from past events can manifest as liver problems and acidity\, fear of change may result in knee problems\, and prolonged grief can impact the lungs. Emotions such as panic can even affect blood sugar levels. \nWhen emotions remain stuck within us\, we find ourselves trapped in the past. Releasing these blocked emotions allows us to return to the present moment\, experience happiness\, and regain our energy. Remarkably\, once emotions are unstuck\, the body and mind can repair themselves with minimal or no medical intervention. The Emotion Deletion Method (EDM) offers an astonishing approach to releasing stuck emotions\, often yielding nearly instantaneous results. \nDuring this workshop\, participants: \n\nLearned the fundamentals of the EDM\nGained insights into the origins of our experiences\nAcquired a method to identify and verify the emotions that debilitate our health in the present moment\nEngaged in the practice of deleting blocked emotions within their systems\nHad the opportunity to ask questions and seek clarifications\n\nThe EDM is an incredibly powerful system that can be learned by anyone\, including children. Teachers stand to benefit greatly from participating in this program\, as the Emotional Well-Being workshop offers: \n\nIncreased teacher efficacy\nA better understanding of classroom dynamics\nSkillful use of emotional expressions to enhance the joy of learning\nImproved student-teacher relationships and a positive school climate\nEnhanced ability to handle children and work pressure effectively\nImproved soft skills\, including self-confidence\, empathy\, and emotional resilience\nHeightened clarity of mind\nIncreased patience\, focus\, and thoughtful communication\nImproved moods and well-being\nPotential reduction in medical expenses\nEmpowerment to enhance personal health\n\nThe Emotional Well-Being workshop provides a transformative experience for teachers\, empowering them to prioritize their emotional well-being and leverage it to create a positive and enriching learning environment.

SUMMARY:School Activities on International Labour Day on 1st May 2023
DESCRIPTION:On International Labour Day\, it is crucial to shine a spotlight on the pressing issue of child labour\, especially in India\, which unfortunately has the highest number of child labourers in the world. At Smile Foundation\, we are committed to promoting “Civic Driven Change” by actively involving schools\, teachers\, students\, and parents in creating sustainable transformations. Our “Child for Child” drive encourages privileged students to extend care and empathy towards underprivileged children\, bridging the gap between the haves and have-nots. \nWith great enthusiasm\, we engaged 15 schools in anti-child labour activities\, and the response we received in the form of pictures\, collages\, school notes\, and press releases is truly heartwarming. The awareness displayed by the students regarding this grave issue is particularly commendable. \nBy involving schools\, we aim to instill a sense of responsibility and empathy in young minds\, making them aware of the challenges faced by their underprivileged peers. Through educational initiatives\, discussions\, and creative projects\, we encourage students to reflect on the importance of eradicating child labour and strive towards a more equitable society. \nThe active participation of schools in these anti-child labour activities demonstrates their commitment to creating a brighter future. It signifies a collective effort toward raising awareness\, advocating for change\, and nurturing a compassionate society. Each picture\, collage\, school note\, and press release serves as a reminder that every small step contributes to the larger goal of eliminating child labour. \nWe cherish the enthusiastic response from schools\, as well as the dedication shown by students and teachers in addressing this pressing issue. Their efforts exemplify the power of education and empathy in driving social change. Together\, we can work towards a society where every child’s rights are protected\, where education is accessible to all\, and where child labour becomes a thing of the past. \nOn this International Labour Day\, let us reiterate our commitment to creating a world where children are free to learn\, play\, and grow\, unburdened by the harsh realities of child labour.
